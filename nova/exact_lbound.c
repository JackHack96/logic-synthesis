/*******************************************************************************
*             NECESSARY CONDITIONS ON THE HYPERCUBE DIMENSION                  *
* (to allow a quick rejection of dimensions unfeasible for a given problem     *
* instance).                                                                   *
* The following necessary conditions that need to be satisfied by a solution   *
* have been found so far :                                                     *
* 1) first counting criterion - the k-face-poset should have at least as many  *
* faces of a given cardinality as the instance poset has constraints of a      *
* a given cardinality                                                          *
* 2) second counting criterion - a constraint cannot have more fathers than    *
* the face of minimum dimension (that can be assigned to it in the current     *
* hypercube) has minimal including neighbours in the current hypercube         *
* 3) third counting criterion - the current hypercube must have at least as    *
* many free positions (#vertices - net_num) as the minimum number of imaginary *
* states to introduce ( plus a corollary on the feasibility of a densest       *
* packing )                                                                    *

    /*                    THIRD COUNTING CRITERION 
       If there are constraints whose cardinality is not a power of 2 ,
       the faces assigned to them will have some frozen vertices , as if
       the initial problem have more than net_num states , ie. some
       "imaginary" states , too . How many imaginary states should 
       we introduce to satisfy the constraints ?
       There are two facts to take into account :
       1) for a constraint of cardinality "c" we need to introduce
                            minpow2(c) - c 
          imaginary states;
       2) at most "cube_dim" constraints can share the same imaginary state.
       Using the two given facts we can compute the minimum # of imaginary
       states, i.e. the densiest packing of imaginary states .
       Since a closed formula for it is ackward, we give a dynamic scheme
       to compute it.
       The bottomline is : the current hypercube must have enough free
       positions (#vertices - net_num) to fit at least the densiest packing. 
       A corollary ot this criterion is the packing condition that checks
       whether introducing imaginary vertices, in a hypercube with no more
       free positions, creates completed constraints sharing intersections
       whose cardinality is not a power of 2 (an unfeasible situation)    */
