    <h1>UNIVR Logic Sythesis Software</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      Welcome to University of Verona's logic sythesis software web portal!<br />
      Here you can find some historical logic sythesis software, like SIS, which is still used for educational
      purposes at <a href="https://www.univr.it">University of Verona</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      The purpose of this site is to host binaries and documentation of old logic sythesis software, some for
      historical reasons and others for learning reasons.<br />
      Being more accurate, SIS, despite being over 30 years old, is still used
      in the course of Computer Architecture of the University of Verona, because of its simplicity and for the
      closeness it has with the things taught during the course. Here you'll find the original one (version 1.3) and
      the refactored one (version 1.4).
      The refactored one features a general refactoring especially in the command line interface.
