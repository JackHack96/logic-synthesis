int
com_atpg(network, argc, argv)
network_t **network;
int argc;
char **argv;

	Perform deterministic test pattern generation on a sequential or
	combinational network.  Network is modified if the -t option is used.

int
com_redundancy_removal(network, argc, argv)
network_t **network;
int argc;
char **argv;

	Perform sequential redundancy removal on a sequential or combinational
	network using deterministic test pattern generation on network.  
	Network is modified.  The network is 100% single stuck-fault testable 
	unless the test generator aborts on any faults.

int
com_short_tests(network, argc, argv)
network_t **network;
int argc;
char **argv;
{
}
	Perform deterministic test pattern generation on a sequential network.
	Several heuristics are used during the test pattern generation process
	to reduce the size of the test set that is generated.
