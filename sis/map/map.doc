map_network(network, library, mode, inv_optz, fanout_flag)
network_t *network;
library_t *library;
double mode;
int inv_optz;
int fanout_flag;

	Implement 'network' using gates from library.  Uses the
	tree-based technology mapping algorithm.  Returns NIL(network_t)
	if any error, in which case error_string() contains a description
	of what went wrong.

	If 'mode' is '0', the area will be minimized.
	If 'mode' is '1', the delay will be minimized.
	If 'mode' is '2', the delay will be minimized on an estimate of the 
	critical path obtained from a trivial 2-input nand mapping.
	If 'mode' is between '0' and '1', then a linear combination of the area
	and delay is minimized.

	Setting 'inv_optz' to '1' ('0'), enables (disables) the 
	inverter optimization

	'fanout_flag' is a mask of 4 flags: [b0,b1,b2,b3]. b0 is the least
	significant bit of the word. For example, if fanout_flag equals 3,
	this means that b0 and b1 are on, b2 and b3 off.
	Setting 'b0' means that the area at a fanout point is estimated
        as being the area of the subtree divided by the number of fanouts.
	Otherwise, the area is assumed to be 0 at a multiple fanout point.
	Setting 'b1' means that the mapper is allowed to introduce overlaps
	(i.e. logic duplication). 
	'b2' is unused.
	Setting 'b3' allows multiple fanouts within gates (i.e. for XOR's, MUX'es). 
	The default value is 11 in area mode and 9 in delay mode.

void
map_add_inverter(network, add_at_pipo)
network_t *network;
int add_at_pipo;
	Add extra inverters nodes to the network such that every pair
	of nand gates is separated by 2 or more inverters.

	Setting 'add_at_pipo' to 1 enables the insertion also at primary inputs
	and outputs.



void
map_remove_inverter(network, report_data)
network_t *network;
VoidFn report_data;
	Remove redundant inverters from the network while keeping the
	network mapped.  If report_data is not NIL, the routine reports
	debugging information by calling the report_data function with the
        network as an argument.
