 * Revision 1.4  1993/05/04  15:30:57  sis
 * BDD package updates.  Tom Shiple 5/4/93.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1993/05/03  20:34:08  shiple
 * Fixed bug in scan_newhalf, which caused some entries not to be scanned
 * over during the second call to scan_newhalf.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1992/09/19  03:13:57  shiple
 * Version 2.4
 * Prefaced compile time debug switches with BDD_. Added typecast to void to some function calls.
 * Removed some dead code.  In relocate, changed location of declaration of reg_old.
 * Fixed bugs in scan_hashcache and scan_constcache.  Before, node pointers
 * were not being regularized before they were checked for BROKEN_HEART, causing some good entries
 * to be killed.  In scan_adhoccache, fixed core leak if item wasn't copied over.  Also, now
 * scan adhoc_cache after garbage collection, rather than at beginning.  Changed ITE and ITE_const
 * caches to be arrays of pointers.  Remember value of manager->heap.cache.*.on for garbage collection.
 * Moved static function declarations to top of file.  In scan_hashcache and scan_constcache, first
 * check if there are no entries in the cache; st check if there are no entries in the cache.

 * Fixed a bug in bdd_garbage_collect. New buckets for the hashtable
 * were being needlessly created on each gc, and old buckets were not
 * being freed.  Now, we just reuse old buckets.
