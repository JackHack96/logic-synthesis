Introduction ------------------------------------------------------------------

The interface for this package is modeled on that described in Brace, Rudell,
Bryant, "Efficient Implementation of a BDD Package", DAC 1990.  The user
manipulates only BDD formulas, corresponding to the data type bdd_t.  A bdd_t is
a pointer to a bdd_node, and more than one bdd_t can point to the same bdd_node.

A BDD manager is a collection of bdd_nodes, which together constitute a number
of BDDs.  A variable ordering is associated with each manager.  Variables are
numbered starting from zero.  This ordering is not stored explicitly in the
manager, but is implicit in the variable ID stored in each node created.  It is
the user's responsibility to define an ordering, and to maintain the
correspondence between application variables and BDD variable IDs.  The BDD
manager maintains the invariant that variables occur in ascending order in every
root-to-leaf path.

A "single variable BDD formula" is a BDD for a single variable: it has one node,
with the THEN branch pointing to 1, and the ELSE branch pointing to 0.

All of the functions which operate on BDD formulas return new BDD formulas.  The
BDDs associated with BDD formulas which are arguments to a function are not
disturbed.  For example, bdd_substitute creates a new BDD and leaves the old one
intact.  To purge the old BDD, free the bdd_t pointing to it, and the next
garbage collection will free those bdd_nodes which can no longer be reached from
a bdd_t.

A user should never allocate bdd_t data structures; this should only be done by
the BDD manager.  A BDD which is only pointed to by a bdd_t allocated by a user
will be treated as garbage during garbage collection since the bdd_t is not
registered with the manager.

For any operation involving multiple BDDs, all the BDDs must belong to the same
manager.  For example, in bdd_and(f, g, 0, 1), the BDDs for 'f' and 'g' must
exist in the same manager.  Also, it is bad form to nest BDD operations because
the returned bdd_t's will be "lost", potentially causing a buildup of garbage
which cannot be collected.  For example, bdd_and(bdd_or(f,g,1,1), bdd_xor(h,e),
1, 0) should be avoided.

IMPORTANT: To reiterate the above points: 1) you should only be using bdd_t's
which are returned by BDD package functions, and 2) you should free bdd_t's
(using bdd_free) as soon as you no longer need them, so that their corresponding
BDDs may be garbaged collected at the next opportunity.

BDD Manager Allocation And Destruction ----------------------------------------

void
bdd_end(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

Frees all the resources associated with a BDD manager.

void
bdd_set_mgr_init_dflts(mgr_init)
bdd_mgr_init *mgr_init;

    Initializes `mgr_init' with the default values.  (See BDD_DFLT_* in bdd.h
    for the default values.)  See bdd_start_with_params and bdd_register_daemon
    for sample usages.

bdd_manager *
bdd_start(nvariables)
int nvariables; 

    Initializes a new BDD manager that can contain at most nvariables.  The BDD
    manager ensures that no variable in the manager is greater than or equal to
    nvariables over the lifetime of the manager.  The range of variable IDs is
    zero to nvariables-1. The manager's nvariables value can be incremented by
    calling bdd_create_variable.  This function also creates the constant 1 BDD,
    and registers it with the manager.

bdd_manager *
bdd_start_with_params(nvariables, mgr_init)
int nvariables; 
bdd_mgr_init *mgr_init;

    Same as bdd_start, but allows user to set the parameters specified in the
    bdd_mgr_init data structure.

    The ITE cache, ITE_const cache, and the adhoc cache store the result of
    previous computations, in an attempt to improve performance. See
    bdd_print_stats for more information on the caches.  For each of the three
    caches, the following fields can be set ("*" is one of ITE, ITE_const,
    adhoc):

      1) *_cache_on: turn it on or off.  In general, the performance of the BDD
      package is horrible if the caches are turned off.

      2) *_cache_resize_at: set the percentage at which you want resizing to
      occur. For example, a value of 85 means to resize when greater than 85% of
      the buckets are being used. This setting does not apply to the adhoc
      cache.

      3) *_cache_max_size: for the ITE and ITE_const caches, set the maximum
      number of buckets allowed in the cache. When this value is reached, the
      caches will not be grown.  For the adhoc cache, set the maximum number of
      entries allowed in the cache.  When this value is reached, new entries
      will not be inserted into the cache.

    garbage_collector.on determines whether or not the garbage collector is
    used.  memory.limit, specified as a positive integer denoting megabytes (1MB
    = 1048576 bytes), places a limit on how much memory the BDD package is
    allowed to use.  memory.deamon specifies the callback routine to be used
    when the memory limit is exceeded.  If a non-default memory limit is
    specified, then a daemon must be given (see bdd_register_daemon for sample
    usage).

    nodes.ratio determines how many new bdd_node blocks should be allocated
    after garbage collection to achieve the desired ratio between "used" and
    "unused" bdd_nodes.  A larger value of nodes.ratio gives the BDDs more room
    to grow before the next garbage collection, but uses more space.
    nodes.init_blocks determines the number of bdd_node blocks allocated at
    initialization.  A larger value of nodes.init_blocks delays the occurrence of
    the first garbage collection.

    bdd_start(n) is equivalent to bdd_start_with_parameters(n, mgr_init), where
    `mgr_init' has been initialized by bdd_set_mgr_init_dflts.

    Below is a sample usage of bdd_set_mgr_init_dflts and bdd_start_with_params:

    bdd_mgr_init mgr_init;
    bdd_manager *manager;

    bdd_set_mgr_init_dflts(&mgr_init);  /* get the defaults */
    mgr_init.adhoc_cache.max_size = 50000;     /* change those you want to */
    mgr_init.node.init_blocks = 20;  
    manager = bdd_start_with_params(SOME_NUMBER, &mgr_init); /* create mgr */




BDD Variable Allocation -------------------------------------------------------

bdd_t *
bdd_create_variable(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

    Returns a single variable BDD formula for a new variable after registering
    the variable with the manager.  This function calls bdd_get_variable with
    the arguments `manager' and the manager's nvariables value, and then
    increments the manager's nvariables value.  Thus, the variable created by
    bdd_create_variable is effectively placed at the end of the current variable
    ordering.

bdd_t *
bdd_get_variable(manager, variable_ID)
bdd_manager *manager;
bdd_variableId variable_ID;	       /* unsigned int */

    If the single variable BDD formula corresponding to variable_ID already
    exists, then return it.  Otherwise, create a new single variable BDD formula
    with ID `variable_ID', register it with the manager, and return it.  This
    function checks that variable_ID is less than the manager's current value of
    nvariables.

    Sample usages of these functions:

    bdd_manager_t *manager;
    bdd_t *bdd;

    manager = bdd_start(SOME_NUMBER);  
    for (i = 0; i < SOME_NUMBER; i++) {
	bdd = bdd_get_variable(manager, i);
	/* do something with bdd */
    }
      .
      .
    bdd = bdd_create_variable(manager); /* create another var, add to end */
      .
      .
    bdd_end(manager);


    The following is equivalent:

    manager = bdd_start(0); 
    for (i = 0; i < SOME_NUMBER; i++) {
	bdd = bdd_create_variable(manager);
	/* do something with bdd */
    }
      .
      .
    bdd = bdd_create_variable(manager); /* create another var, add to end */
      .
      .
    bdd_end(manager);


BDD Formula Management --------------------------------------------------------

bdd_t *
bdd_dup(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Returns a copy of the BDD formula.  No new bdd_nodes are created, since the
    existing bdd_nodes will be shared.

void
bdd_free(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Frees the bdd_t `bdd'.  During garbage collection, a bdd_node is freed if it
    cannot be reached starting from a bdd_t.  Intermediate results and unused
    bdd_t's should be freed as soon as you no longer need them.  For example:

    /* to compute f + gh */
    temp = bdd_and(g, h, 1, 1);
    result = bdd_or(f, temp, 1, 1);
    bdd_free(temp);



Operations on BDD Formulas ----------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: All of the operations in this section return a pointer to a bdd_t.
Such a bdd_t is registered with the BDD manager.  The garbage collector locates
all bdd_nodes which can be reached by recursive descent from the bdd_t's
registered with the manager, and these nodes are saved.  All nodes not reachable
are considered garbage and are destroyed.  The function bdd_free "unregisters" a
bdd_t.  Thus, it is crucial that you use bdd_free to unregister bdd_t's after
you no longer need them so that the garbage collector can reclaim as much space
as possible.

bdd_t *
bdd_and(f, g, f_phase, g_phase)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;
boolean f_phase;
boolean g_phase;

    Returns the BDD formula for the and of `f' and `g' in the phases specified
    by `f_phase' and `g_phase'. For example, bdd_and(f,g,0,1) will return the
    BDD formula for (f' and g).  Don't forget the phase arguments.

bdd_t *
bdd_and_smooth(f, g, smoothing_vars)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;
array_t *smoothing_vars;	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Ands and smooths `f' and 'g' with respect to the `smoothing_vars'.
    `smoothing_vars' is an array of bdd_t *'s, which are the single variable BDD
    formulas to be smoothed out.

bdd_t *
bdd_between(f_min, f_max)
bdd_t *f_min;
bdd_t *f_max;

    Returns a heuristically minimized BDD containing `f_min', and contained in 
    `f_max'.  Calls bdd_minimize(f_min, f_min+!f_max);

bdd_t *
bdd_cofactor(f, g)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;

    Returns the BDD formula of cofactor of `f' with respect to `g'. `g' must be
    different from 0.  If `g' is a cube, this computes the usual cofactor.  If
    `g' is not a cube, then this computes the generalized cofactor.

bdd_t *
bdd_compose(f, v, g)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *v;
bdd_t *g;

    Returns the BDD formula with `v' replaced by `g' in `f'. `v' must be a
    single variable BDD formula.

bdd_t *
bdd_consensus(f, quantifying_vars)
bdd_t *f;
array_t *quantifying_vars;	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Returns the BDD formula of `f' universally quantified with respect to the 
    variables in the array `quantifying_vars'.  `quantifying_vars' is an array 
    of bdd_t *'s, which are the single variable BDD formulas to be quantified.

bdd_t *
bdd_cproject(f, var_array)
bdd_t *f;
array_t *var_array;	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Returns the BDD corresponding to the compatible projection of `f' onto the
    variables in `var_array'.  `f' is interpreted as the characteristic
    function of a one-to-many relation.  `var_array' is an array of bdd_t *'s,
    which are single variable BDD formulas.  The reference vertex is hardcoded
    to be all 1's.
   
    The compatible projection operator is used to symbolically manipulate
    equivalence classes.  See the following for more details: Bill Lin,
    "Implicit Manipulation of Equivalence Classes using Binary Decision
    Diagrams", International Conference on Computer Design, Cambridge,
    Massachusetts, November, 1991.

bdd_t *
bdd_else(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Returns the BDD formula of the function when the top_var of `bdd' evaluates
    to 0.  The return value takes into account that `bdd' may be a "complemented
    pointer".

bdd_t *
bdd_ite(i, t, e, i_phase, t_phase, e_phase)
bdd_t *i;
bdd_t *t;
bdd_t *e;
boolean i_phase;
boolean t_phase;
boolean e_phase;

    Returns the BDD formula resulting in the ITE of `i', `t' and `e'.  For
    example, bdd_ite(i, t, e, 1, 0, 1) will return the BDD formula for ((i and
    t') or (i' and e)).

bdd_t *
bdd_not(f)
bdd_t *f;

    Returns the BDD formula for the complement of `f'.

bdd_t *
bdd_minimize(f, c)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *c;

    Returns bdd_minimize_with_params(f, c, BDD_MIN_OSM, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE).

bdd_t *
bdd_minimize_with_params(f, c, match_type, compl, no_new_vars, return_min)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *c;
bdd_min_match_type_t match_type;
boolean compl;
boolean no_new_vars;
boolean return_min;

    Minimizes `f' with respect to the care function `c'; that is, `f' is a don't
    care wherever `c' is 0.  The result contains f*c, and is contained in f+!c.
    `match_type' is one of BDD_MIN_OSM, BDD_MIN_OSDM, or BDD_MIN_TSM.  When
    `compl' is TRUE, matches between sub-functions and the complements of others
    are attempted.  When `no_new_vars' is TRUE, the variables in the result will
    be a subset of those in `f'. When `return_min' is TRUE, if the result is 
    larger than `f', then a copy of `f' is returned.  The restrict operator of 
    Coudert and Madre, ICCAD '90, p. 126, is (BDD_MIN_OSDM, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE), 
    and the constrain operator (which is the same as bdd_cofactor) is 
    (BDD_MIN_OSDM, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE).  See Shiple et al., "Heuristic 
    Minimization of BDDs Using Don't Cares," UCB ERL Memo, UCB/ERL M93/58, for 
    more details.

bdd_t *
bdd_one(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

    Returns a BDD formula pointing to the constant function 1 of the manager.

bdd_t *
bdd_or(f, g, f_phase, g_phase)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;
boolean f_phase;
boolean g_phase;

    Returns the BDD formula for the or of `f' and `g' in the phases specified by
    `f_phase' and `g_phase'. For example, bdd_or(f, g, 0, 1) will return the BDD
    formula for (f' or g).

bdd_t *
bdd_smooth(f, smoothing_vars)
bdd_t *f;
array_t *smoothing_vars;	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Returns the BDD formula of `f' existentially quantified with respect to 
    the variables in the array `smoothing_vars'.  `smoothing_vars' is an array of 
    bdd_t *'s, which are the single variable BDD formulas to be quantified.

bdd_t *
bdd_substitute(f, old_array, new_array)
bdd_t *f;
array_t *old_array;	/* of bdd_t *'s */
array_t *new_array;	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Substitute all old_array vars with new_array vars. `old_array' and
    `new_array' are arrays of bdd_t *'s.  Given two arrays of variables a and b
    consisting of member values (a1 .. an) and (b1 .. bn), replace all
    occurrences of ai by bi. This could be done iteratively with bdd_compose but
    would require n passes instead of one.  Thus, this algorithm is only a
    performance optimization.

bdd_t *
bdd_then(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Returns the BDD formula of the function when the top_var of `bdd' evaluates
    to 1.  The return value takes into account that `bdd' may be a "complemented
    pointer".

bdd_t *
bdd_top_var(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Returns the BDD formula corresponding to the top variable of `bdd'.  For
    example, if the top variable of 'bdd' is x, then returns the single variable
    BDD formula for x.

bdd_t *
bdd_xnor(f, g)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;

    Returns the BDD formula for the xnor of `f' and `g'.

bdd_t *
bdd_xor(f, g)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;

    Returns the BDD formula for the xor of `f' and `g'.

bdd_t *
bdd_zero(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

    Returns the BDD formula pointing to the constant function 0 of the manager
    (a complemented pointer to the constant function 1).


Queries about BDD Formulas ----------------------------------------------------

boolean
bdd_equal(f, g)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;

    Checks if the two BDD are identical; returns `1' if they are, `0' otherwise.

boolean
bdd_is_cube(f)
bdd_t *f;

    Returns TRUE if `f' is a cube, else returns FALSE.  `f' is a cube if it has
    a single path to the constant ONE node.

boolean
bdd_is_tautology(f, phase)
bdd_t *f;
boolean phase;

    Checks if the given function is tautologously true. `phase' indicates the
    phase to be used for `f', i.e. phase==1 checks if f==1 and phase==0 checks
    if f'==1.

boolean
bdd_leq(f, g, f_phase, g_phase)
bdd_t *f;
bdd_t *g;
boolean f_phase;
boolean g_phase;

    Checks for implications. `f_phase' and `g_phase' indicate the phases to be
    used for `f' and `g'. For example, bdd_leq(f, g, 1, 0) returns returns the
    value of (f => g').  (While this can be done using bdd_or and then checking
    if this result is a constant value, using bdd_leq is generally faster and
    uses less memory.  Note that bdd_leq uses the ITE_const cache.)


Statistics and Other Queries --------------------------------------------------

double 
bdd_count_onset(fn, var_array)
bdd_t *fn;
array_t *var_array;  	/* of bdd_t *'s */

    Counts the number of minterms in the onset of the function `fn', over the 
    variables in `var_array' (single variable BDD formulas).  `var_array' must 
    contain the variables in the support of `fn'.  For example, if fn=b*d, and
    var_array=[a,b,c,d], then this function returns 4.0.

bdd_manager *
bdd_get_manager(f)
bdd_t *f;

    Returns the bdd_manager to which `f' is associated.

bdd_node *
bdd_get_node(f, is_complemented)
bdd_t *f;
boolean *is_complemented;    /* return */

    Return the regularized (i.e. uncomplemented) pointer to the bdd_node 
    to which `f' refers.  Also, returns whether or not the bdd_node pointer
    is complemented.  Note well: the address of a bdd_node changes upon
    garbage collection.  If your code is sensitive to the addresses of 
    bdd_nodes, and you invoke BDD routines which cause new bdd_nodes to be
    created, then a garbage collection may automatically be triggered.  To
    prevent a garbage collection from automatically occurring, use 
    bdd_set_gc_mode to turn off garbage collection before a sensitive piece
    of code is executed.

void
bdd_get_stats(manager, stats)
bdd_manager *manager;
bdd_stats *stats;	/* return */

    Statistics for the BDD manager are returned in stats; these stats can then
    be used directly in a call to bdd_print_stats.  Statistics include
    information about usage of caches, number of ITE operations, number of
    bdd_node's and bdd_t's, and operation of the garbage collector.

    Following is a sample usage:

	bdd_stats stats;  /* allocate a struct, not a pointer to a struct */

	bdd_get_stats(manager, &stats);
	bdd_print_stats(stats, stdout);

var_set_t 
*bdd_get_support(fn)
bdd_t *fn;

    Returns the support of `fn' in terms of the variables in the BDD manager.
    The result is returned as a bit array (see the var_set package).

array_t *
bdd_get_varids(var_array)
array_t *var_array;  /* of bdd_t * */

    Given an array of single variable BDD formulas, returns an array of the 
    same length whose entries are the corresponding bdd_variableIds of the BDDs.

unsigned int 
bdd_num_vars(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

    Returns the number of variables in the BDD manager.

void
bdd_print(f)
bdd_t *f;

    A representation of the BDD is printed out on the standard output.  For
    example, the following is printed out for the function z = !a*b + a*!b where
    the indices (variable IDs) for a and b are 0 and 1 respectively.  A "!"
    before an address indicates a complemented pointer.  Note that the variables
    from the root to the leaves of the BDD are in ascending order.

    node: a
	    index 0 is v#0
	    index 1 is v#1
    ID =  0x1007651	index = 0	T =  1		E =  0

    node: b
	    index 0 is v#0
	    index 1 is v#1
    ID =  0x1007652	index = 1	T =  1		E =  0

    node: {z}
	    index 0 is v#0
	    index 1 is v#1
    ID = !0x1007655	index = 0	T =   0x1007652	E = !0x1007652
    ID =  0x1007652	index = 1	T =  1		E =  0


void
bdd_print_stats(stats, file)
bdd_stats stats;
FILE *file;

    Print the statistics as returned by bdd_get_stats.  The following is a
    sample output.

    "Blocks" gives the number of pairs of bdd_nodeBlocks allocated.  A
    bdd_nodeBlock is an array of bdd_nodes. Blocks are allocated in pairs since
    an equal space must be maintained for the stop-and-copy garbage collector.
    Thus, at any time, only one block of the pair is being used.  For a given
    manager, the number of blocks is a non-decreasing number over time.  The
    number of blocks initially allocated can be controlled by using
    bdd_start_with_params.

    "Nodes" gives the number of bdd_nodes currently in use ("used"), and the
    number currently available for use ("unused").  Their sum is "total".
    "total" divided by the number of blocks gives the number of nodes per block.
    "peak" gives the maximum value of "used" seen so far.  Nodes which are not
    reachable from bdd_t's, but which have not been garbage collected yet, are
    counted under "used".  If garbage nodes are found during a garbage
    collection, then "used" will decrease and "unused" will increase.
    Immediately following a garbage collection, more bdd_nodeBlocks are
    allocated (if sufficient memory exists) so that the ratio of "used" to
    "unused" is 2 to 1.  This ratio can be controlled by using
    bdd_start_with_params.

    "Extptr" gives the number of bdd_t's currently in use ("used") and the
    number currently available for use ("unused").  Their sum is "total".

    "Hashtable" gives statistics on the table which maintains the uniqueness of
    bdd_nodes.  Before a new node is inserted into the table, a find_or_add call
    is made.  If the node already exists in the table, a "hit" is recorded, and
    if not, a "miss" is recorded and the node is added to the table.

    "Caches" gives statistics on the caches used to improve the performance of
    the BDD package.  A cache is used to remember the result of certain
    computations.  The ITE cache remembers the results of ITE(f,g,h) operations;
    the ITE_const cache remembers the result of ITE_const operations (used only
    for bdd_leq; see the Brace paper); the adhoc cache remembers the results of
    "adhoc operations" (bdd_and_smooth, bdd_cofactor, bdd_compose, bdd_cproject,
    bdd_smooth, and bdd_substitute).  Only one ITE cache and one ITE_const cache 
    are used throughout the lifetime of a manager.  On the other hand, a new 
    adhoc cache is created each time an application calls an adhoc operation; the 
    cache is destroyed at the end of the operation.

    These caches are appropriately modified so that they are consistent after a
    garbage collection.  An entry ((f,g,h), result) in the ITE or ITE_const
    cache is saved only if f, g, h and `result' survived the garbage collection.
    All the entries in the adhoc cache are saved.

    "Total calls" gives the number of calls to the "core" function involved.
    For example, for the ITE cache, this gives the number of calls to bdd__ITE_.
    Note that these core functions are recursive.  Of the total number of calls,
    "trivial" gives the percentage for which the result is determined trivially
    (e.g. bdd__ITE_(1,g,h) = g), "cached" gives the percentage for which the
    result was found in the cache, and "full" gives the percentage for which a
    full computation had do be performed.  The sum of these three percentages is
    100%.

    "Total lookups" gives the number of non-trivial calls.  "misses" gives the
    percentage of lookups which resulted in a cache miss.  "Total inserts" gives
    the number of cache misses, which is the number of insertions into the
    cache.

    The ITE and ITE_const caches do not maintain collision chains: they are
    "closed" caches.  Consequently, if a key hashes to a bucket which is already
    occupied, causing a collision, then the old key is destroyed and the new key
    takes its place.  "collisions" gives the percentage of insertions which
    result in a collision.  The adhoc cache is an open cache, and thus there are
    no collisions.

    "Garbage Collections" gives the total number of garbage collections, the
    cumulative number of nodes collected, and the total time spent garbage
    collecting.

    "Memory Usage" gives a breakdown of the memory used by various components of
    the BDD manager.  "manager" refers to the bdd_manager data structure.
    Remember that the adhoc cache is destroyed after each call to an operation
    that uses the adhoc cache, and thus will probably read 0. The memory usage
    statistics are not updated incrementally; they are only updated by calling
    bdd_get_stats.

    Upon certain memory allocation failures in the BDD package, statistics are
    printed under the title "BDD Manager Death Statistics" before the program
    exits.

int
bdd_size(bdd)
bdd_t *bdd;

    Returns the size of the BDD: 1 for the constant functions 0 and 1, 2 for a
    single variable BDD formula, and so on.

bdd_variableId
bdd_top_var_id(f)
bdd_t *f;

    Returns the variable ID of the bdd_node to which `f' refers.  The variable
    ID of a node never changes.  The result is undefined if `f' refers to one
    of the constant functions.



Traversal of BDD Formulas -----------------------------------------------------

int 
bdd_gen_free(gen)
bdd_gen *gen;

    Frees the bdd_gen `gen'.  This should be called after breaking out of 
    foreach_bdd_cube or foreach_bdd_node.  Always returns 0.

foreach_bdd_cube(fn, gen, cube)
bdd_t *fn;
bdd_gen *gen;
array_t *cube;	  /* return of bdd_literal */

    The BDD corresponding to `fn' is traversed via `gen', with `cube' being
    filled with successive members of the BDD formula onset.  The cube is an
    array of bdd_literals.  A bdd_literal can have values 0 (variable appears
    complemented), 1 (variable appears not complemented), or 2 (variable does
    not appear).  The cover generated is disjoint.  The BDD is traversed using
    depth-first search, with the ELSE branch searched before the THEN branch.
    The same array `cube' is used for each iteration; do not attempt to free
    it, and use array_dup if you need to remember it.  A single array is 
    allocated for `cube' by the generator, and it is freed when the generator 
    completes, or when bdd_gen_free is called.

foreach_bdd_node(fn, gen, node)
bdd_t *fn;
bdd_gen *gen;
bdd_node *node;	  /* return */

    The BDD corresponding to `fn' is traversed via `gen', with `node' being
    filled with each node in the BDD.  The BDD is traversed using depth-first
    search, with the ELSE branch searched before the THEN branch, and a node
    returned only after its children have been returned.  Note that the returned
    bdd_node pointer has the complement bit zeroed out.


    These generators are macros.  Typical usage is:

	foreach_bdd_node(fn, gen, node) {
	    /* do something with node */
	}

    Caution: If you are creating new BDDs while iterating through the nodes or
    cubes, and a garbage collection happens to be performed during this process,
    the program will abort.  To avoid this, use bdd_set_gc_mode to toggle the
    garbage collector off before you start the iteration, and back on after you
    have completed the iteration.



Miscellaneous -----------------------------------------------------------------

bdd_external_hooks *
bdd_get_external_hooks(manager)
bdd_manager *manager;

    Returns a pointer to the external_hooks data structure of `manager'. The
    external_hooks structure is used to store application-specific data with
    the manager.

void
bdd_register_daemon(manager, daemon)
bdd_manager *manager;
void (*daemon)();

    Register `daemon' as the function to be called from the BDD manager when the
    application-specified memory limit is exceeded.  If no memory limit is set,
    then no daemon needs to be registered.  The `daemon' must take a pointer to
    bdd_manager as its only argument and must return void:

      void daemon(manager)
      bdd_manager *manager;

    Memory allocations in the BDD package fall into three categories: 

      1) bdd_nodeBlock allocations - the memory limit is checked.  If the limit
      will be exceeded, then the current, partial computation is cleared, the
      garbage collector is called, and then the daemon is called.

      2) cache allocations - the memory limit is checked.  If the limit will be
      exceeded, then the allocation is not made, and the BDD package continues.
      Such allocations only serve to cache previous results, and thus not making
      such allocations trades off time in favor of space.

      3) small, one-time allocations or temporary allocations - the memory limit
      is not checked.  (Also included in this category are allocations of
      bdd_t's.)

    Following is a sample usage:

    static void
    my_callback(manager)
    bdd_manager *manager;
    {
	bdd_stats stats;

	bdd_get_stats(manager, &stats);
	bdd_print_stats(stats, stdout);
	(void) fprintf(stdout, "Exceeded memory limit\n");
	exit(1);
    }

    int check_networks_equal(ntwk1, ntwk2, num_vars)
    network_t *ntwk1;
    network_t *ntwk2;
    int num_vars;
    {
	bdd_manager *manager;
	bdd_mgr_init mgr_init;

	bdd_set_mgr_init_dflts(&mgr_init); /* get defaults */
	mgr_init.memory.limit = 10;               /* set at 10 megabytes */
	mgr_init.memory.deamon = my_callback;     /* set daemon */
	manager = bdd_start_with_params(num_vars, &mgr_init); 
	return(networks_equal(manager, ntwk1, ntwk2));
    }


    Another sample usage (see "man setjmp" for details on setjmp and longjmp):

    #include <setjmp.h>            /* defines jmp_buf, setjmp, longjmp */
    static jmp_buf my_jmpbuf          /* global variable */
    static void mem_limit_callback()  /* callback routine */
    {
	longjmp(my_jmpbuf, 1);
    }

    void simplify_network(network, manager)
    network_t *network;
    bdd_manager *manager; /* already initialized and in use */
    {
	node_t *node;
	lsGen gen;

	bdd_register_daemon(manager, mem_limit_callback);
	foreach_node(network, gen, node){
	    if (setjmp(my_jmpbuf) > 0) {
		/* memory limit exceeded; go to next node */
		continue;  
	    }
	    simplify_node_using_bdds(node);
	}
    }

void
bdd_set_gc_mode(manager, no_gc)
bdd_manager *manager;
boolean no_gc;		

    If no_gc==0, turn on garbage collection, else if no_gc==1, turn off garbage
    collection.

void 
bdd_dynamic_reordering(manager, algorithm_type)
bdd_manager *manager;
bdd_reorder_type_t algorithm_type;

    Prints the following message: "WARNING: Dynamic variable reordering not 
    implemented in the Berkeley BDD package."
