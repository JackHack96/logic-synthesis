   This file carries routines that move fanins f around of a node n
   that are not critical. f is made a fanin of g (a fanin of n) that 
   is feasible and has some vacancy in it. This is done by collapsing g
   into n, then look for a decomposition (roth-karp) with bound set that includes
   {fanins of g different from the ones of n} U {f}. If number of equivalence 
   classes is 2, you can do it!!! g has to be a single fanout node, not a PI.
   
   Notes:
   1) Assumes that a delay trace has been done on the network.

   2) We are restricting ourselves by looking at only disjoint decomposition.

   3) Of course, we are ignoring the possibility of collapsing some other node
   into g later. Difficult to take into account.
