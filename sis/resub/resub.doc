Summary:
    resub_alge_node();
    resub_alge_network();


int
resub_alge_node(f, use_complement)
node_t *f;
int use_complement;
    Algebraic re-substitution of f into all other nodes in the network.
    It returns 1 if f is substituted into some other notes, 0 otherwise.
    If use_complement is 1, the substitution uses both f and its complement.
    Because it uses algebraic division, only the immediate fanouts of the
    immediate fanins of f can possibly be simplified.  No action is taken
    if f is a primary input, a primary output, or a 
    constant function.


void
resub_alge_network(network, use_complement)
network_t *network;
int use_complement;
    Does resub_alge_node on each function in the network until no more
    improvement can be made.
