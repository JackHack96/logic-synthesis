Summary:
	gcd_prime_factorize();
	gcd_nodevec();

array_t *
gcd_prime_factorize(f)
node_t *f;
	Returns a vector of nodes, each of which is a prime factor of f.  The
	first node in the vector is the cube divisor of f, (the node 1 if f is
	cube-free).  Error if f == 0 or f is nil.


node_t *
gcd_nodevec(nodelist)
array_t *nodevec;
	Given a vector of nodes, f1,..fn, returns their greatest common
	divisor. Error if the vector is empty, or if every fi == 0.
