read_eqn [-a] [filename]
.PP
Read a set of logic equations in the format expected by eqntott(1).
Each equation becomes a node in the logic network.
.PP
INORDER and OUTORDER can be used to specify the primary inputs and
primary outputs for the network.  If neither is given, then primary
inputs are inferred from signals which are not driven, and
primary outputs are inferred from signals which do not have any
fanout.
.PP
The equations are of the form "<signal> = <expr> ;".
For reference, the equation format uses the operators:
.LP
.TS
center box;
l l.
()	grouping
!= (or ^)	exclusive-or 
==	exclusive-nor
! 	complement
& (or *)	boolean-and
| (or +)	boolean-or
.TE
As a simple extension to eqntott, juxtaposition of two operands stands
for boolean-and, and ' used as a post-fix operator stands for complement.
Hence, 
.nf
	F = a*!b + c*!d ;
.fi
and
.nf
	F = a b' + c d' ;
.fi
represent the same equation.
.PP
Note that eqntott and \fBread_eqn\fR treat the intermediate nodes of a network
slightly differently.
\fBread_eqn\fR will not make an intermediate node
a primary output unless it also appears in the OUTORDER list.
Also, the resulting network is a multiple-level network with all
of the intermediate signals preserved.
Finally, eqntott is order-dependent in that it requires signals to
be defined before they can be used again; \fBread_eqn\fR relaxes this
condition.
.PP
The \fB-a\fR option specifies that the new network should be appended to the
current network.  Functions are associated between the two networks
using the long names of each network.  Name conflicts (where two
functions attempt to define the same name) generate warning messages
and are resolved by renaming the signal from the new network.
.PP
The \fB-s\fR option, though accepted, has no effect on \fBread_eqn\fR
and is instead
reserved for the \fBread_pla\fR command.
.pp
Note that since the characters '(' and ')' are used for grouping,
they cannot be part of a signal name.
