xl_cover [-n number] [-h heuristic number]
.br
.PP
For mapping onto Xilinx architecture.
The initial network
should have all intermediate nodes with fanin less than
or equal to \fBnumber\fP (default is 5).
Mathony's binate covering algorithm is used to
minimize the number of nodes in the network.
Different heuristics are used to solve the covering
problem. The heuristic number can be specified
by \fB-h\fP option. Heuristic number can be 0, 1, 2 or 3:
.br
.PP
-  0 (exact),
.PP
-  1 (Mathony's method - stop when first leaf is reached),
.PP
-  2 (For large examples),
.PP
-  3 (default:  automatically decides between 0 and 2)
