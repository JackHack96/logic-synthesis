   timeout [-t n] [-k]
 
     Sends an interrupt to the SIS process. With no argument, this routine
     inactivates any previous calls.
 
     The -t n specifies the timeout limit, in seconds.
 
     The -k option specifies that a kill signal is to be sent to SIS rather
     than a interrupt signal.
