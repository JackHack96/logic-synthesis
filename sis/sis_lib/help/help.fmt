   help [-a] [command]
 
     Given no arguments, help prints a list of all commands known to the com-
     mand interpreter.  The -a option provides a list of all debugging com-
     mands, which by convention begin with an underscore.  If a command name
     is given, detailed information for that command will be provided.
