decomp [-gqd] [node-list]
.PP
Decompose all the nodes in the \fBnode-list\fR.  If the \fBnode-list\fR
is not specified, all the nodes in the current network will be
decomposed.  Decompostion will factor nodes and make the divisor a new
node within the network, re-expressing other nodes in terms of this
newly introduced node.  It is one of the transforms used to break
down large functions into smaller pieces, usually at the cost of
introducing a few more literals.
.PP
If the \fB-q\fR option (the default) is specified, the \fIquick decomp\fR 
algorithm is used which
extracts out an \fIarbitrary\fR kernel successively.  Because
of the fast algorithm for generating an arbitrary kernel,
\fBdecomp -q\fR is very fast compared with the \fBdecomp -g\fR.
In most cases, the result is very close.
This command is recommended at the early phase of the optimization.
.PP
If the \fB-g\fR option is specified, the \fIgood decomp\fR
algorithm is used which
successively extracts out the \fIbest kernel\fR until the function is
factor free, and applies the same algorithm to all the kernels just extracted.
This operation will give the best \fIalgebraic\fR decomposition for the nodes.
But, since it generates all the kernels at each step, it takes more
CPU time.  In general, \fBdecomp -q\fR should be used in the early
stage of the optimization. Only at the end of the optimization, should
\fBdecomp -g\fR be used.
.PP
If the \fB-d\fR option is specified, the disjoint decomposition
is performed.  Currently, the disjoint decomposition is limited
to the following simple algorithm:  It partitions the cubes
into sets of cubes having disjoint variable support, creates
one node for each partition, and a node (the root of the 
decomposition) which is the OR of all the partitions.
