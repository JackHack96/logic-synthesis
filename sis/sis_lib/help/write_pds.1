write_pds [-c] [-d] [-s] [filename]
.PP
Write the current network to file \fBfilename\fP in the \fIpds\fP
format suitable for Xilinx.  
The \fIpds\fP descriptions are generated for single output CLBs
(LUTs) only.
.PP
The \fB-c\fP option indicates that only the combinational portion
of the network should be written out.
.PP
The \fB-d\fP option will cause debugging information to be printed.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option uses the network short names rather than the
network long names for the \fIpds\fP file.
