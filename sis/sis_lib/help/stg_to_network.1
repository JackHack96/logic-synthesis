stg_to_network [-e option]
.PP
Takes the current state-encoded state transition graph and generates 
an optimized two-level logic network.  The initial mapping is optimized
using a two-level Boolean minimizer (i.e. \fBespresso\fR)
along with the invalid
state codes as don't cares.
\fB-e\fR allows the user to specify how
the two-level logic-encoded network should be processed using \fBespresso\fR.
The option can be
either 0, 1, or 2.
The \fB-e 0\fR option simply runs espresso and executes \fBread_pla\fR.
The \fB-e 1\fR option runs \fBespresso\fR, but does a
\fBread_pla -s\fR instead.
This reads in the PLA in single-level form (fully collapsed) rather than 
two-level form.
This often produces better results.
The \fB-e 2\fR option
runs \fBespresso -Dso\fR, which does a single-output minimization.
Again, \fBread_pla -s\fR is used.
This option also produces better results for some
cases, but typically takes more time.
The default is the \fB-e 1\fR option.
