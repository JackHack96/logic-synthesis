   read_blif [-a] filename
 
     Read in a network from the file filename which is assumed to be in _b_l_i_f
     format.  The network name is given by the ._m_o_d_e_l statement in the file.
     If a ._m_o_d_e_l is not given, the network name is the filename with any
     trailing extension removed.  See the blif.tex document for a complete
     description of the _b_l_i_f format.
 
     The user can also specify an external don't care network. This network
     must be placed after the care network in the same file. The statement
     ._e_x_d_c must precede the description of the external don't care network.
     The names of primary outputs and primary inputs of the external don't
     care network must be exactly the same as the names of primary outputs
     and primary inputs of the care network.
 
     Usual filename conventions apply: - (or no filename) stands for standard
     input, and tilde-expansion is performed on the filename.
 
     Normal operation is to replace the current network with a new network.
     If no external don't care network is specified, the external don't care
     network is set to NIL (nonexistent). Otherwise the external don't care
     network is replaced by the new external don't care network.  The -a
     option specifies that the new network should be appended to the current
     network.  Functions are associated between the two networks using the
     long names of each network.  Name conflicts (where two functions attempt
     to define the same name) generate warning messages and are resolved by
     renaming the signal from the new network.
 
     The -s option, though accepted, has no effect on read_blif, and is
     instead reserved for the read_pla command.
