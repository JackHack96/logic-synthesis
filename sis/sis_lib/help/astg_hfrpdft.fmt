   astg_hfrpdft [-v debug_level]
 
     Make each node in the network hazard-free robustly path-delay fault
     testable.  Test inputs may be added as a side effect of this command.
 
     It should be called immediately after astg_to_f, on the initial two-
     level cover (see astg_to_f for a recommended script file).  Remember
     that hazard-free robust path-delay fault testability is maintained only
     by _a_l_g_e_b_r_a_i_c optimization.
