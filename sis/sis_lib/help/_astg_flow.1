astg_flow [-x] [-l <latch-type>] [-o <out-file>]
.PP
Do exhaustive token flow on an ASTG, forming a state graph
using the ASTG signals to define the state codes.
A next-state logic function is extracted from the state
graph in two-level form.
Then the next state logic is converted into a network
which can be manipulated using the standard \fISIS\fP
network commands.
.PP
The generated network has PI and PO names which match the
signal names specified in the ASTG.
The network has one special structural requirement: for any
signal which is used for feedback, the real PO is attached
to the output of the feedback latch (i.e. connected to the
fake PI for the latch).
This is necessary for other ASTG commands to work properly.
.PP
The -l option specifies the type of latches to insert for
feedback signals.
The default is type "as" (asynchronous).
.PP
The -o option writes the BLIF description of the network
to a file but does not change the current SIS network.
.PP
Normally astg_flow does a structural net check to make sure
the marking is live-safe, using the one-token state machine
condition proposed by T.A. Chu.
This can be extremely time consuming, so the -x option
bypasses this check and does the token flow using the
existing initial marking.
