.XX
print_latch [-s] [node-list]
.PP
With no arguments, \fBprint_latch\fR prints out information for
all the latches in the network.
The information printed for each latch is the latch input, latch output,
initial value, current value, synchronization type, and controlling node.
The latch values can be 0, 1, 2 (don't care), and 3 (undefined).

If the \fB-s\fR option is specified, only the latch input, output, initial
and current values are given.
If a \fBnode-list\fR is given, only the latches associated with those
nodes are printed (each node should be a latch input or output).
