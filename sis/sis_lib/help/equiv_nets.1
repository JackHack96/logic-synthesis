equiv_nets [-v n]
.PP
This command simplifies the network using net equivalence.
With \fBfull_simplify\fR, it is one of the two routines able to take
advantage of network don't cares.  
.PP
\fBequiv_nets\fR groups all nets of the network by equivalence classes.
Two nets are equivalent if and only if they always compute the same
function with respect to the external care set. It only uses input
don't cares, not observabiilty don't cares.
.PP
For each equivalence class, \fBequiv_nets\fR selects a lowest cost
net, and moves the fanout of all the other nets of the equivalence
class onto the lowest cost net.
.PP
Finally, it calls the command \fBsweep\fR.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows the specification of the verbosity level of the output.
The default value is 0.
