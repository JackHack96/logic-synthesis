   verify [-m method] [-v] file1 [file2]
 
     Verify the Boolean equivalence of two networks.  file1 is compared with
     the current network when file2 is not specified, otherwise, file1 is
     compared with file2.  The input and output variables from two networks
     are associated by their names.
 
     The -m option specifies the verification method.  If method is _c_l_p
     (default), two networks are collapsed and compared as PLA's.  If method
     is _b_d_d, the BDD's are constructed for both networks and compared.
 
     The -v option engages the "verbose" mode of verify.
