   gkx [-1abcdfo] [-t threshold]
 
     Extract multiple-cube common divisors from the network.
 
     The -a option generates all kernels of all function in the network when
     building the kernel-intersection table.  By default, only level-0 ker-
     nels are used.
 
     The -b option chooses the best kernel intersection as the new factor at
     each step of the algorithm; this is done by enumerating and considering
     each possible kernel intersection, and choosing the best.  By default,
     the more efficient _p_i_n_g-_p_o_n_g algorithm is used to find a good (but not
     necessarily the best) kernel intersection.
 
     The -c option uses the new factor and its complement when attempting to
     introduce the new factor into the network.
 
     The -d option enables debugging information which traces the execution
     of the kernel extract algorithm.
 
     The -f option uses the number of literals in the factored form for the
     network as the cost function when determining the value of a kernel
     intersection; by default, the number of literals in the sum-of-products
     form for the network is used.
 
     The -o option allows for overlapping factors.
 
     The -t option sets a threshold such that divisors are extracted only
     while their value exceeds the threshold.  By default, the threshold is 0
     so that all possible multiple-cube divisors are extracted from the net-
     work.
 
     The -1 option performs only a single pass over the network.  By default,
     the kernel extract algorithm is iterated while there are still divisors
     whose value exceeds the given threshold.
