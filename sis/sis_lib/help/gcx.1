gcx [-bcdf] [-t threshold]
.PP
Extract common cubes from a network, re-express the network
in terms of these cubes, and in the process cut down on the
number of literals needed in the network.
.PP
The \fB-b\fP option chooses the best cube at each step when examining
possible cubes to be extracted; otherwise, the more efficient \fIping-pong\fP
algorithm is used to find a good (but not necessarily the best) cube
at each step.
.PP
The \fB-c\fP option uses the complement of each cube as well as the cube
when dividing the new cube into the network.
.PP
The \fB-f\fP option uses the number
of literals in the factored form for the
network as a cost function for determining the best cube to be extracted.
.PP
The \fB-t\fP option sets a threshold such that only a cube with a value
greater than the threshold will be extracted.  By default, the threshold is
0, so that all possible cube divisors are extracted.
.PP
The \fB-d\fP option enables a debugging mode which traces the execution
of gcx.
