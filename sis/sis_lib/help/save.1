save filename
.PP
Save a copy of the current executable to a file which can be restarted.
This can be used to freeze the current network or the current library
for later optimization.  When the executable \fBfilename\fR is executed,
execution returns to the top-level of the command interpreter.
.PP
NOTE: The \fBsave\fR command is very operating-system dependent and may not
be implemented on your system.
If this is the case then the \fBsave\fR
command is unusable on your system.
