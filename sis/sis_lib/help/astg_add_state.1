.XX
astg_add_state [-v debug_level] [-m]
.PP
Adds state signal transitions to the Signal Transition Graph to guarantee
implementability (see \fBastg_state_min\fR for a recommended script file).
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option does not preserve the original ASTG marking, and forces its
re-computation (may be slow; dubious usefulness).
