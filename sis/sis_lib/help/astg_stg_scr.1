astg_stg_scr [-v debug_level] 
.PP
Transforms the current State Transition Graph into one that satisfies the
Single Cube Restriction. 
.PP
The Single Cube Restriction means that each state has exactly one associated
value of input signals under which it is entered. The result is accomplished by
state duplication, but the result may be non-minimal.
This command is required (and useful) before \fBstg_to_astg\fR.
