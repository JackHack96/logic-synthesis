factor [-gq] node-list
.PP
Throw away the old factored forms and factor each node in the 
\fBnode-list\fR, and store the factored forms with the nodes.
If the \fB-q\fR option is specified, the \fIquick factor\fR algorithm
is used to factor the node.
If the \fB-g\fR option is specified, the \fIgood factor\fR
algorithm is used to factor the node.
