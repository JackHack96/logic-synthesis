.PP
Simplify each node in the network using the local don't cares
generated in terms of fanins of each node.
First compatible
observability plus external don't cares are generated for
each node in terms of primary inputs.
Then the image
computation techniques are used to map these don't cares
to the local space of each node.
This technique removes
most redundancies in the network.
The satisfiability don't cares
for a subset of the nodes in the network which have the same 
support as the node being simplified is also generated.
An ordering is given to the nodes of the network
and local don't cares for the nodes are computed according
to that ordering.
Each node is simplified using its local don't cares and an
appropriate satisfiability don't care subset.

.PP
\fB-d\fR If this option is used no observability don't cares are computed.
In this case the local don't cares are only the unreachable points
in the local space of each node (a subset of the satisfiability
don't care set).

.PP
\fB-o\fR Used for BDD ordering. If 0 (default) is used, variables
are ordered based on their depth. If 1 is used, the level of
a node is used for its ordering.

.PP
\fBmethod\fR specifies the algorithm used to minimize the nodes.
\fIsnocomp\fR (default) invokes a single pass minimization procedure that does
not compute the complete offset.
\fInocomp\fR invokes the full minimization procedure (ala ESPRESSO) but does
not compute the complete offset.
\fIdcsimp\fR invokes single pass tautology-based minimizer.

.PP
\fB-l\fR generates fanin don't cares only for nodes
with the same or subset support as the node being minimized
which have level less than the node being minimized. The level
is the largest number of nodes on the longest  path from the node to
a primary input.

.PP
\fB-v\fR prints out extra info for debugging the code.
