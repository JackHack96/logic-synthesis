history [-h] [num]
.PP
Lists previous commands and their event numbers.
The \fB-h\fP option suppresses printing the event number.
If \fBnum\fP is specified, lists the last \fBnum\fP events.  Lists the last
30 events if \fBnum\fP is not specified.
.PP
History Substitution:
.PP
The history substitution mechanism is a simpler version of the csh history
substitution mechanism.  It enables you to reuse words from previously typed
commands.
.PP
The default history substitution character is the `%' (`!' is default for shell
escapes, and `#' marks the beginning of a comment). This can be changed using
the "set" command. In this description '%' is used as the history_char.
The `%' can appear
anywhere in a line.  A line containing a history substitution is echoed to
the screen after the substitution takes place.  `%' can be preceded by a
`\\' in order to escape the substitution, for example, to enter a `%' into
an alias or to set the prompt.
.PP
Each valid line typed at the prompt is saved.  If the \fBhistory\fP variable
is set (see help page for \fBset\fP), each line is also echoed to the history
file.  You can use the "history" command to list the previously typed
commands.
.PP
Substitutions: at any point in a line these history substitutions are
available
