   retime [-nfim] [-c #.#] [-t #.#] [-d #.#] [-a #.#] [-v #]
 
     Applies the retiming transformation on the circuit in an effort to
     reduce the cycle time. The retiming operation is supported only for sin-
     gle phase, edge-triggered designs. Both mapped and unmapped networks can
     be retimed.  The algorithm attempts to maintain the initial state infor-
     mation.
 
     The algorithm expects to work on mapped networks so that accurate delays
     on the gates can be used.  However, an unmapped network can be retimed
     by using the -n option.  In that case the delay through each node is
     computed according to the _u_n_i_t-_f_a_n_o_u_t delay model.  _T_h_e _u_s_e_r _s_h_o_u_l_d _b_e

     By default the algorithm uses a relaxation based approach which is very
     fast. An alternate formulation uses a mathematical programming formula-
     tion and can be selected using the -f option.  After profiling on a
     number of circuits only one will be retained.
 
     The -m option can be used to minimize the number of registers under
     cycle time constraints. If the cycle time is not specified using the -c
     option then this command will try to minimize the cycle time. Thus to
     obtain the absolute minimum number of registers for a circuit the user
     should specify a very loose cycle time constraint (very large value for
     the -c option).
 
     The retiming algorithm will try to compute the new initial states of the
     latches.  In case no feasible initial state exists the retiming is
     aborted and the network is not modified. To suppress the initialization
     routine use the -i option. In that case the initial values for all the
     latches after retiming is set to value of 2 (DONT_CARE).
 
     The desired clock period can be specified with the -c value option. When
     this option is not used the algorithm first checks to see if there is a
     cycle_time specification with the current network (the value depends on
     the current setting of the clock_flag in the network) and tries to meet
     this. If no cycle_time is specified with the design the retiming opera-
     tion tries to minimize the cycle time. For this it uses a binary search
     for testing feasible clock values. The tolerance of the binary search
     can be specified with the -t value option (the default is 0.1).
 
     Latches in the network can be assigned a propogation delay and an area.
     These are helpful in the realistic modelling of the circuit delay and
     area. Use the -d value option to specify the delay through a latch (to
     approximate the setup and propogation delay of the latch) and the -a
     value option to specify the area of a latch. In case of mapped networks,
     these values are automatically determined from the library of gates.
 
     The -v value selects the verbosity level. The range is 1-100 (100 will
     literally swamp you with a lot of unneeded data). Use the value 1 to see
     the progress of the algorithm.
