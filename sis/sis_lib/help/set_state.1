.XX
set_state [-s] [-i] [name]
.PP
Sets the current state in the machine to the given state.
If no
state is given, it sets the current state to the initial state (resets
the machine).
If the \fB-s\fR option is given, only the state of the
STG is changed; if the \fB-i\fR option is specified, only the state of the
logic implementation is changed.  If no logic implementation exists,
or if only the state of the STG is to be changed, then the state name
should be symbolic; otherwise it should be the encoded name of the state.
