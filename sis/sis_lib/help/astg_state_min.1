astg_state_min [-v debug_level] [-p minimized_file] [-c "command"]
[-b|-B] [-g|-G] [-u] [-m|-M] [-o #] [-f signal_cost_file]
.PP
Minimizes the current State Transition Graph and derives the information
required to encode the associated Signal Transition Graph.
The complete sequence of actions to implement a Signal Transition Graph that
does not have Complete State Coding is as follows:
.br

.br
astg_to_stg -m
.br
astg_state_min
.br
astg_encode
.br
astg_add_state
.br

.br
astg_to_f
.br
 ...
.PP
The \fB-f\fR option selects a signal cost file. 
This file should contain one line of the form
.br
<signal name> <cost>
.br
(e.g. "bus_ack 10") for each signal in the ASTG. The encoding algorithm 
minimizes the sum of the weights of signals that follow state transitions.
Hence this file can be used to strongly favor or disfavor changing the
predecessors of the transitions of a signal. 
.PP
By default, output signals have a cost of one and input signals have a
cost equal to the number of output signals plus one. In this way, no input
signal is constrained, if possible.
.PP
The command may emit a series of diagnostic messages of the form:
.br
warning: the STG may not be live (multiple exit point): may need constraint
<signal 1> -> <signal 2>
.br
These messages may or may not cause a failure (diagnosed as internal error)
later on during \fBastg_add_state\fR. In case of failure, \fBone\fR of the
required constraints (ideally the constraint that least decreases the circuit
performance due to the reduction in concurrency) should be added to the ASTG.
The procedure should be repeated until no more such messages occur.
.PP
The options listed below are not generally useful except for debugging purposes
or to obtain faster (but potentially less optimal)
results for large Signal Transition Graphs.
All algorithm speed indications reflect average case analysis.
.PP
The \fB-B\fR and \fB-b\fR options select Binary Decision Diagrams
as internal data structure to find the encoding information (both are generally
slower than the default selection, but \fB-b\fR is generally
faster than \fB-B\fR).
.PP
The \fB-M\fR and \fB-m\fR options select Sparse Matrices
as internal data structure to find the encoding information (both are generally
slower than the default selection, but \fB-m\fR is generally
faster than \fB-M\fR). If \fB-M\fR is selected, then \fB-o\fR can be used to
define some further internal options (this is strongly discouraged).
.PP
The \fB-G\fR and \fB-g\fR options select a greedy (\fB-g\fR) or very greedy
(\fB-G\fR) heuristic
to find the encoding information (both faster and looser than the default
selection).
.PP
The \fB-u\fR option selects a generally slower
heuristic to find the encoding information.
.PP
The \fB-c\fR option allows to use a different minimizer from the default
choice. The minimizer must be able to read and write .kiss format and to write
equivalence class information in the output file, in the following format:
.br
#begin_classes <number of classes>
.br
# <state name> <class number>
.br
 ...
.br
#end_classes
.PP
The \fB-p\fR option avoids calling the minimizer altogether, just reading in
the specified minimized file (in .kiss format with equivalence class
information).
