.XX
state_minimize progname options
.PP
Perform state minimization on the current STG.
The program used for state minimization is \fBprogname\fP
and it is given the options \fBoptions\fP.
The program \fBprogname\fP must exist somewhere in the user's
path.
.PP
The state minimization program is given the current STG, and
returns a new STG.  After execution of the \fBstate_minimize\fP
command, only the STG is available for optimization (any existing
logic implementation is removed, since there is no guarantee that
it implements the new STG).
.PP
The state minimization program called must conform to the
specification (see doc/SPEC).
Currently, the program that is compatible with this specification
and is shipped with \fBSIS\fR is \fBstamina\fR (from the University of Colorado,
Boulder, rho@boulder.colorado.edu).
To get help information for a specific program, use the \fB-h\fR option
(i.e. \fBstate_minimize stamina -h\fP would produce help information for
the \fBstamina\fR state minimization program).
