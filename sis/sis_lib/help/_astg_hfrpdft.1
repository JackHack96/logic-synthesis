Make each node in the network hazard-free robustly path-delay fault testable.
Test inputs may be added as a side effect of this command.

It should be called immediately after \fBastg_to_f\fR, on the initial two-level
cover (see \fBastg_to_f\fR for a recommended script file).
Remember that hazard-free robust path-delay fault
testability is maintained only by \fIalgebraic\fR
optimization.
