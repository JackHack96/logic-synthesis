   factor [-gq] node-list
 
     Throw away the old factored forms and factor each node in the node-list,
     and store the factored forms with the nodes.  If the -q option is speci-
     fied, the _q_u_i_c_k _f_a_c_t_o_r algorithm is used to factor the node.  If the -g
     option is specified, the _g_o_o_d _f_a_c_t_o_r algorithm is used to factor the
     node.
