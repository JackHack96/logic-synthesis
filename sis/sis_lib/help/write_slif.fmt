   write_slif [-s] [-n] [-d] [filename]
 
     Write the current network to the file filename in the Stanford Logic
     Interchange Format (_S_L_I_F).
 
     The -s option uses the network short names rather than the network long
     names for the _S_L_I_F file.  This can be used to encrypt the names of a
     net-list.
 
     The -n option uses the net-list format of _S_L_I_F when a node has a gate
     implementation in the library.
 
     The -d option makes the _S_L_I_F writer print out any delay information
     known about the current network.  This is not the default because a
     standard for printing delay information has not been established for the
     _S_L_I_F format.
