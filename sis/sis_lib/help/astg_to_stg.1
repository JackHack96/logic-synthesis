.PP
Generate a State Transition Graph
from the current Signal Transition Graph.
The State Transition Graph has one input signal for each signal in the Signal
Transition Graph (both input and output), and one output signal for each output
signal in the Signal Transition Graph.
.PP
If the initial marking is not defined, then a valid marking is searched for.
.PP
An error message results if no valid marking is found (in which case it
might be advisable to define it in the ASTG specification file).
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option additionally performs a pre-minimization step that produces
a State Transition Graph suitable for subsequent state encoding commands (such
as, e.g., \fBastg_state_min\fR).
