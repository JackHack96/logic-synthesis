   source [-psx] filename
 
     Read commands from a file.  The -p option prints a prompt before reading
     each command, and the -x option echoes each command before it is exe-
     cuted.  The -s option silently ignores an attempt to execute commands
     from a nonexistent file.
 
     Arguments on the command line after the filename are remembered but not
     evaluated.  Commands in the script file can then refer to these argu-
     ments using the history substitution mechanism.
 
     EXAMPLE:
 
          Contents of test.scr:
 
              read_blif %:2
              collapse
              write_eqn %:2.eqn
 
          Typing "source test.scr lion.blif" on the command line will execute
          the sequence
 
              read_blif lion.blif
              collapse
              write_eqn lion.blif.eqn
 
          If you type "alias st source test.scr" and then type "st lion.blif
          bozo", you will execute
 
              read_blif bozo
              collapse
              write_eqn bozo.eqn
 
          because "bozo" was the second argument on the last command line
          typed.  In other words, command substitution in a script file
          depends on how the script file was invoked.
 
     Some standard script files are provided.  _s_c_r_i_p_t (executed by typing
     source script is a script that works well on most examples.
     _s_c_r_i_p_t._b_o_o_l_e_a_n uses a larger part of the don't care set during two-level
     minimization, requiring more time and producing better results.
     _s_c_r_i_p_t._a_l_g_e_b_r_a_i_c uses a smaller part of the don't care set.
     _s_c_r_i_p_t._r_u_g_g_e_d uses the newest BDD-based techniques, and _s_c_r_i_p_t._d_e_l_a_y
     synthesizes a circuit for a final implementation that is optimal with
     respect to speed.
