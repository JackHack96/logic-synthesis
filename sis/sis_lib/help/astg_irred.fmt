     Delete or print structurally redundant constraints in the ASTG.  A
     redundant constraint is essentially a constraint from some transition x*
     to transition z* when there is also a constraint from x* to y* to z*
     (there are additional global conditions in which the constraint x* to z*
     is not redundant, see Chu's dissertation).  In this case z* is already
     constrained to follow x* and so the explicit constraint is redundant.
 
     The -p option just prints constraints which have been identified as
     redundant without modifying the ASTG.
