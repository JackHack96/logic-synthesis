resub [-a] [-b] [-d] [node-list]
.PP
Resubstitute each node in the \fBnode-list\fR into all the nodes in the network.
The resubstitution will try to use both the \fIpositive\fR and \fInegative\fR
phase of the node.  If \fBnode-list\fR is not specified, the resubstitution
will be done for every node in the network and this operation will keep
looping until no more changes of the network can be made.  Note
the difference between \fBresub *\fR and \fBresub\fR.  The
former will apply the resubstitution to each node only once.
.PP
The \fB-a\fR (default) option uses algebraic division when
substituting one node into another.
The division is
performed on both the divisor and its complement.
.PP
The \fB-b\fR option uses Boolean division when substituting one
node into another.
NOTE: Boolean resubstitution has not yet been implemented.
.PP
The \fB-d\fR option directs \fBresub\fR not to use the complement of a given
node in algebraic resubstitutions.
