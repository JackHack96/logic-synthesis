   gcx [-bcdf] [-t threshold]
 
     Extract common cubes from a network, re-express the network in terms of
     these cubes, and in the process cut down on the number of literals
     needed in the network.
 
     The -b option chooses the best cube at each step when examining possible
     cubes to be extracted; otherwise, the more efficient _p_i_n_g-_p_o_n_g algorithm
     is used to find a good (but not necessarily the best) cube at each step.
 
     The -c option uses the complement of each cube as well as the cube when
     dividing the new cube into the network.
 
     The -f option uses the number of literals in the factored form for the
     network as a cost function for determining the best cube to be
     extracted.
 
     The -t option sets a threshold such that only a cube with a value
     greater than the threshold will be extracted.  By default, the threshold
     is 0, so that all possible cube divisors are extracted.
 
     The -d option enables a debugging mode which traces the execution of
     gcx.
