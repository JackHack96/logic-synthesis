fanout_alg [-v] alg_list
.PP
Activates selectively one or more fanout algorithms. For a list of 
fanout algorithms known to the system, use the \fB-v\fR option.
The algorithms activated are the ones specified in the list.
One algorithm, \fInoalg\fR, is always active.
\fItwo_level\fR 
is a fast, area efficient algorithm. The best results are
obtained with \fItwo_level\fR, \fIbottom_up\fR, \fIlt_trees\fR,
and \fImixed_lt_trees\fR.
.PP
Fanout optimization itself is performed using the \fBmap\fR command.
