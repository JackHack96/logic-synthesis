verify [-m method] [-v] file1 [file2]
.PP
Verify the Boolean equivalence of two networks.  \fBfile1\fR
is compared with the current network when \fBfile2\fR is not
specified, otherwise, \fBfile1\fR is compared with \fBfile2\fR.
The input and output variables from two networks are associated
by their names.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option specifies the verification method.
If \fBmethod\fR is \fIclp\fR (default), two networks are collapsed and
compared as PLA's.
If \fBmethod\fR is \fIbdd\fR, the BDD's are constructed for both networks and
compared.
.PP
The \fB-v\fR option engages the "verbose" mode of verify.
