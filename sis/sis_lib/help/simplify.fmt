   simplify [-d][-i <num>[:<num>]] [-m method] [-f filter] [node-list]
 
     Simplify each node in the node-list using _m_e_t_h_o_d with the don't-care set
     generated according to _d_c_t_y_p_e.
 
     _m_e_t_h_o_d specifies the algorithm used to minimize the nodes.  _s_n_o_c_o_m_p
     (default) invokes a single pass minimization procedure that does not
     compute the complete offset.  _n_o_c_o_m_p invokes the full minimization pro-
     cedure (ala ESPRESSO) but does not compute the complete offset.  _d_c_s_i_m_p
     invokes single pass tautology-based minimizer.
 
     _d_c_t_y_p_e specifies how the don't-care set is generated.  The default don't
     care set generated is a subset of the fanin don't care set.  -d option
     specifies that no don't care set is used.  -i m:n specifies that the
     fanin don't cares of nodes within m levels of transitive fanin and n
     levels of transitive fanout of these transitive fanin are to be gen-
     erated.
 
     _f_i_l_t_e_r specifies how the don't-care set is filtered.  _e_x_a_c_t (default)
     uses the exact filter.  _d_i_s_j__s_u_p uses the disjoint support filter.
 
     Note that a node function is replaced with the simplified version if the
     new function has fewer literals in factored form.  In the case of a tie,
     the node function is replaced if the new function has fewer literals in
     sum-of-products form.
