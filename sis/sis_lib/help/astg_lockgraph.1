astg_lockgraph [-l]
.PP
Build the lock graph for the current ASTG.
.PP
With the -l option, edges are added to
the ASTG to ensure that the lock graph
is connected, and thus that the ASTG has the Complete State
Coding property.
.PP
If an ASTG has the CSC property, the state of the circuit can
be represented completely by the collection of input, output
and internal signals specified in the ASTG.
This simplifies many synthesis algorithms.
.PP
The algorithm works only for ASTGs that are marked graphs (no choice).
See \fBastg_state_min\fR for a set of commands that
ensure Complete State Coding for more general ASTGs.
