   wd [-c] node1 node2
 
     The wd command (which stands for "weak division") is very similiar to
     resubstitution (resub command), except that instead of operating on the
     entire network, wd simply re-expresses node1 in terms of node2.
 
     The -c option allows re-substitution of the complement of node2.
