simulate in1 in2 in3 ...
.PP
For the current implementation of the network, given a value ('0' or '1')
for each of the primary inputs of the network, simulate prints the value
produced at each of the primary outputs.  The correspondence of the
input values and the primary inputs can be determined by the order in
which the primary inputs and outputs are printed using the \fBwrite_eqn\fR
command.
.PP
For example, for a three-input AND gate, the command

\fB	simulate 1 1 0\fR

will produce a 

	0
.PP
NOTE:  For sequential circuits, this command essentially assumes that all
latches are clocked simultaneously by a single clock.
Simulation will take the current values on the latches (which can be
displayed by using \fBprint_latch\fR) and the user-supplied primary
input values
and simulate the network, placing the new latch values in the
current state of the latches.
The values of the outputs and the new state are printed.
If a more sophisticated simulation method is needed, timing simulation
should be used; this is not currently implemented in SIS.
