Decompose all the nodes in the current network into AND gates
or OR gates or both depending on whether \fB-a\fR,
\fB-o\fR, or both flags are specified.
The fanins of AND gates
will be no more than \fBand-limit\fR and that of the OR gates
will be no more than \fBor-limit\fR.  \fBand-limit\fR and
\fBor-limit\fR, if specified, must be at least 2.
The default option is \fB-a 2\fR.
