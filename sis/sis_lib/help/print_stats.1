print_stats [-f] [-d]
.PP
Print the current network status, which includes the network name,
number of primary inputs (pi), number of primary outputs (po),
number of nodes (nodes), the number of latches (latches),
the number of literals in the sum-of-product
form (lits(sop)), and the number of states in the STG
(#states(STG)).
.PP
If \fB-f\fR option is specified, the number of literals in
the factored form (lits(fac)) is computed.
This could be slow when 
the factored form for some network takes too long to generate. 
.PP
If \fB-d\fR option is specified, the statistics of the external don't care
network is printed.
