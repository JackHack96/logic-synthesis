write_eqn [-s] [filename]
.PP
The \fBwrite_eqn\fR command prints out the equations from the current
network according to format specifications laid out in the
documentation for \fBread_eqn\fR.
Both primary inputs and outputs are indicated.
.PP
The \fB-s\fR option uses the network short names rather than the
network long names for the output.
.PP
If \fBfilename\fR is not specified the equations will be written to
standard out, otherwise they will be written into the given file and
may be read by \fBread_blif\fR at a later time.
.PP
Note that since the eqn format uses the '(' and ')' characters
for grouping, they cannot appear in any of the signal names.
