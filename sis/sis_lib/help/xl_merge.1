xl_merge [-f MAX_FANIN] [-c MAX_COMMON_FANIN] [-u MAX_UNION_FANIN] 
         [-n support] [-o filename] [-vlF]
.PP
Used for mapping onto Xilinx architecture.
It selects pairs of nodes of the network that can be merged
so as to minimize the number of nodes.
and solves an integer program using the package Lindo.
In the end it lists the pairs of nodes that were merged.
The command does not change the network.
.PP
\fB-f\fP: MAX_FANIN is the limit on the fanin of a mergeable node (default = 4).
.br
.PP
\fB-c\fP: MAX_COMMON_FANIN is the limit on the common fanins of two
mergeable nodes (default = 4).
.br
.PP
\fB-u\fP: MAX_UNION_FANIN is the limit on the union of the fanins of two
mergeable nodes (default = 5).
.br
.PP
\fB-n\fP: support is the limit on the number of fanins of a single function that 
can be put on a CLB (default = 5).
.br
.PP
\fB-o\fP: filename is the file in which information about the nodes merged is 
printed. Must specify.
.br
.PP
\fB-l\fP: Do not use lindo, an integer-linear programming package used to solve 
the matching problem. Instead use a heuristic. If not specified, the program first 
searches for lindo in the path. If found, lindo is invoked, else the program 
automatically calls the heuristic.
.br
.PP
\fB-F\fP: If the input network is say a 4-feasible network and the support = 5, it 
may be possible to reduce the number of nodes after matching. If this option is not 
used,\fBxl_partition\fP is called after matching step on the subnetwork composed of 
unmatched nodes. Otherwise, only matching is done and the network remains unchanged.
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP:  turns on the verbosity flag.  When used, information about the
   algorithm is printed as it executes.
