alias [name [string]]
.X1
unalias name ...
.PP
The \fBalias\fR command, if given no arguments, will print the
definition of all current aliases.  Given a single argument, it
will print the definition of that alias (if any).  Given two
arguments, the keyword \fBname\fP becomes an alias for
the command string \fBstring\fP, replacing any other alias with the
same name.
The \fBunalias\fR command removes the definition of an alias.
.PP
It is possible to create aliases that take arguments by using the history
substitution mechanism.  To protect the history substitution character `%'
from immediate expansion, it must be preceded by a `\\' when entering the
alias.  For example:
.IP
.nf
sis> alias read read_\\%:1 \\%:2.\\%:1
sis> alias write write_\\%:1 \\%:2.\\%:1
sis> read blif lion
sis> write eqn tiger
.fi
.PP
will create the two aliases `read' and `write', execute "read_blif
lion.blif", and then execute "write_eqn tiger.eqn".  And...
.fi
.IP
.nf
sis> alias echo2 "echo Hi ; echo \\%* !"
sis> echo2 happy birthday
.fi
.PP
would print:
.IP
.nf
Hi
happy birthday !
.fi
.PP
\fBCAVEAT:\fR Currently there is no check to see if there is a circular
dependency in the alias definition. e.g.
.IP
.nf
sis> alias foo "print_stats -f; print_level -l; foo"
.fi
.PP
creates an alias which refers to itself. Executing the command "foo" will
result an infinite loop during which the commands "print_stats -f" and
"print_level -l" will be executed.
