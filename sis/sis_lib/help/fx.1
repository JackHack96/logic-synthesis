.PP
Greedy concurrent algorithm for finding the best double cube divisors and
single cube divisors.
Finds all the double cube and single cube divisors
of the nodes in the network.
It associates a cost function to each node,
and extracts the node with the best cost function greedily.
.PP						 
The \fB-o\fP option only looks for  0-level two-cube divisors.
.PP
The \fB-b\fP option reads an upper bound for the number of divisors
generated. The default value is 50000. This is because the 
number of divisors in some cases can grow very large.
.PP
The \fB-l\fP option changes the level of each node in the network as allowed
by the slack between the required time and arrival time at that node. 
.PP
The \fB-z\fP option uses zero-weight divisors (in addition to divisors with
a larger weight).  This means that divisors that contribute zero gain to
the overall decomposition are extracted.  This may result in an overall
better decomposition, but take an exhorbitant amount of time.
