.PP
Given an infeasible network, replaces each internal infeasible node
by a set of feasible nodes. These nodes are derived by trying
different decomposition strategies (like xl_ao, xl_split,
cofactoring, decomp -d and tech_decomp -a 2 -o 2), each followed
by a partition/cover phase. In the end, picks the best result (the
one with minimum number of feasible nodes). The result is a feasible network. 
.PP
\fB-n\fP: support is the size of the TLU block (default = 5)
.br
.PP
\fB-A\fP  do not move fanins around after decomp -g.
.br
.PP
\fB-a\fP:  do not apply all decomposition methods. Only cube-packing on
sum-of-product (SOP), cube-packing on factored-form (if g flag
!= 0) and cofactoring. If this option is not specified, also apply
Roth-Karp, tech_decomp, decomp -d, and xl_split.
.br
.PP
\fB-b\fP:  for best results, use this option.
Effective on a node only if its number of
literals is greater than lit_bound. In that case, after the good decomposition,
recursively call the command for each of the nodes in 
decomposition. Time consuming.
.br
.PP
\fB-c\fP:  sets the limit for the cover algorithm used after each
decomposition. If the number of feasible nodes for an infeasible node
is no more than cover_node_limit, then exact cover is used, else
heuristic (-h 3) option is used. (default = 25).
.br
.PP
\fB-g\fP:  if 0 (default), do not use decomp -g for cube-packing, just
SOP. If 1, use only decomp -g, not SOP. If 2, use both decomp -g and SOP for
cube-packing, and pick the best result.
.br
.PP
\fB-l\fP:  if the infeasible node has greater than lit_bound literals,
does a good decomposition of the node (i.e. decomp -g) (default: 50)
.br
.PP
\fB-m\fP:  While doing partition, move fanins around for a node with at
most MAX_FANINS (default 15).  
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP: this sets the verbosity level (amount of information printed
as the algorithm proceeds) to \fBverbosity_level\fP.
