     Decide for each node whether to implement the node or its complement in
     order to reduce the total cost of the network.  If the network is
     mapped, the cost is the total area and the network will be kept mapped,
     otherwise, the cost is the total number of inverters in the network
     assuming all the inverters are already in the network.  At the end, all
     the necessary inverters are inserted into the network and all the extra
     inverters are removed from the network.
 
     The default algorithm, which can also be specified by -q option, is a
     greedy algorithm called _q_u_i_c_k _p_h_a_s_e.  The -g option uses the Kernighan-
     Lin type algorithm called _g_o_o_d _p_h_a_s_e.  The -s option chooses the Simu-
     lated Annealing algorithm.  The -r n option chooses a random-greedy
     algorithm which does a random assignment first, uses a greedy approach
     to get to a local minimum, and iterates _n times.  If the -t option is
     specified, some tracing information is printed as the assignment
     proceeds.
