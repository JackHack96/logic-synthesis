print_level [-l] [-c] [-m model] [-t value] [node-list]
.PP
Prints the nodes of the network according to their level. 
When called with a \fBnode-list\fR, only the nodes in the
transitve fanin of the specified nodes are printed.
The primary inputs are assigned level 0, and the level of
a node is the length of the longest path from it to a
primary input. The \fB -l\fR options prints only the 
number of levels in the network.
.PP
If the \fB-c\fR option is specified, only critical nodes are
printed according to their level. The delay trace is done
according to the \fB-m model\fR option (default is the 
unit-fanout model) and all the nodes with a slack within a
\fB-t value\fR of the smallest slack are considered to be
critical.
