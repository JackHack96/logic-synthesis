   astg_add_state [-v debug_level] [-m]
 
     Adds state signal transitions to the Signal Transition Graph to guaran-
     tee implementability (see astg_state_min for a recommended script file).
 
     The -m option does not preserve the original ASTG marking, and forces
     its re-computation (may be slow; dubious usefulness).
