.XX
xl_coll_ck [-n support] [-c collapse_input_limit] [-kv]
.PP
Assumes a feasible network.
If the number of inputs to the network is at most
\fBcollapse_input_limit\fP (default 9), collapse the network,
apply Roth-Karp decomposition and cofactoring schemes.
Pick the best result and compare with the original network
(before collapsing). If the number of nodes is smaller, accept the 
better decomposition. Does nothing if n = 2.
.PP
\fB-k\fP: does not apply Roth-Karp decomposition, just use cofactoring.
.br
.PP
\fB-n\fP: support is the size of the TLU block (default = 5)
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP: turns on the verbosity flag.  When used, information about the
   algorithm is printed as it executes.
