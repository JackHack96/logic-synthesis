astg_marking [-s] [<marking>]
.PP
Display or set the initial marking of the ASTG.
If no marking is given, the current initial marking is
displayed.
The default format for the marking is the same as for the
\fB.marking\fP command of read_astg.
.PP
The -s option uses a state code format for the marking.
This is a list of signal name and value pairs.
For example, to set an initial state with signal A at
value 0 and B at value 1, use the command:
.br
astg_marking -s A 0 B 1
