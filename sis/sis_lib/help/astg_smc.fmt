   astg_smc [<component-index>]
 
     Generate all the state machine (SM) components of the ASTG.  If an
     optional index is given, then also print the specified component number.
 
     For example, if an ASTG has 3 SM components, then astg_smc 2 will print
     the vertices in the second component.
