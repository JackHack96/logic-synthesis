retime [-nfim] [-c #.#] [-t #.#] [-d #.#] [-a #.#] [-v #]
.PP
Applies the retiming transformation on the circuit in an
effort to reduce the cycle time. The retiming operation is 
supported only for single phase, edge-triggered designs. Both
mapped and unmapped networks can be retimed.
The algorithm attempts to maintain the initial state information.
.PP
The algorithm expects to work on mapped networks so that accurate
delays on the gates can be used.
However, an unmapped network can be retimed by using
the \fB-n\fR option.
In that case the delay through 
each node is computed according to the \fIunit-fanout\fR delay model.
\fIThe user should be aware of the fact that when retiming circuits
containing complex registers (JK, D-flip flops with enables/presets),
the complex registers may have to be decomposed into simpler gates.\fR
.PP
By default the algorithm uses a relaxation based approach which
is very fast. An alternate formulation uses a mathematical 
programming formulation and can be selected using the \fB-f\fR option.
After profiling on a number of circuits only one will be retained.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option can be used to minimize the number of registers
under cycle time constraints. If the cycle time is not specified 
using the \fB-c\fR option then this command will try to minimize the
cycle time. Thus to obtain the absolute minimum number of registers
for a circuit the user should specify a very loose cycle time constraint
(very large value for the \fB-c\fR option).
.PP
The retiming algorithm will try to compute the new initial states
of the latches.
In case no feasible initial state exists the retiming is aborted and
the network is not modified. To suppress the initialization routine
use the \fB-i\fR option. In that case the initial values for all the
latches after retiming is set to value of 2 (DONT_CARE).
.PP
The desired clock period can be specified with the \fB-c value\fR 
option. When this option is not used the algorithm first checks to see
if there is a cycle_time specification with the current network (the
value depends on the current setting of the clock_flag in the network)
and tries to meet this. If no cycle_time is specified with the design
the retiming operation tries to minimize the cycle time. For this it 
uses a binary search for testing feasible clock values. The tolerance of
the binary search can be specified with the \fB-t value\fR option (the
default is 0.1).
.PP
Latches in the network can be assigned a propogation delay and an
area. These are helpful in the realistic modelling of the circuit
delay and area. Use the \fB-d value\fR option to specify the delay
through a latch (to approximate the setup and propogation delay of
the latch) and the \fB-a value\fR option to specify the area
of a latch. In case of mapped networks, these values are automatically
determined from the library of gates.
.PP
The \fB-v value\fR selects the verbosity level. The range is 1-100
(100 will literally swamp you with a lot of unneeded data). Use 
the value 1 to see the progress of the algorithm.
