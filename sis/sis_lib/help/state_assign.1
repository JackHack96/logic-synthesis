.XX
state_assign progname options
.PP
Perform state assignment on the current STG.
The program used for state assignment is \fBprogname\fP
and it is given the options \fBoptions\fP.
The program \fBprogname\fP must exist somewhere in the user's
path.
.PP
The state assignment program is given the current STG, and
returns a logic implementation.  After execution of the \fBstate_assign\fP
command, both the STG and the logic implementation are available
for optimization.
.PP
The state assignment program called must conform to the
specification (see doc/SPEC).
Currently, the programs that are compatible with this specification
and are shipped with SIS are nova and jedi.
To get help information for a specific program, use the -h option
(i.e. \fBstate_assign nova -h\fP would produce help information for
the nova state assignment program).
.PP
A one-hot encoding can be obtained by using \fBstate_assign progname -e h\fP.
Note that nova and jedi produce different results for one-hot encoding.
jedi produces typical one-hot codes (1000) while nova produces one-hot
codes with don't care conditions (1---).
