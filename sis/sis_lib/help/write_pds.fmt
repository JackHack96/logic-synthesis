   write_pds [-c] [-d] [-s] [filename]
 
     Write the current network to file filename in the _p_d_s format suitable
     for Xilinx. The _p_d_s descriptions are generated for single output CLBs
     (LUTs) only.
 
     The -c option indicates that only the combinational portion of the net-
     work should be written out.
 
     The -d option will cause debugging information to be printed.
 
     The -s option uses the network short names rather than the network long
     names for the _p_d_s file.
