env_seq_dc [-v n] filename.blif
.PP
This command extracts sequential don't cares based on unreachable
states. It builds the product of the current network with the network
passed as argument, computes the set of reachable states of the
product, extracts from that the set of reachable states of the
original network, and uses its complement to build a don't care
network for the current network. Any previous don't care network is
discarded. 
.PP
\fBfull_simplify\fR or \fBequiv_nets\fR should be run afterwards to
exploit these don't cares.
.PP
External inputs of the current network are connected to matching
external outputs of the network passed as argument and vice-versa.
Nodes match if and only if they have the same name.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows the specification of the verbosity level of the output.
The default value is 0.
.PP
The method used to compute the set of reachable states is the
\fBproduct\fR method. See \fBextract_seq_dc\fR for details.
