.XX
print_value [-a] [-d] [-p n] node-list
.PP
Print the value of all the nodes in the \fBnode-list\fR.  The value
is currently defined as the number of literals increased if the node
were eliminated from the network.  Since the value of a node depends
on the particular factored form of the node and its fanouts, all the
nodes which don't have factored forms will be factored using
\fIfactor -q\fR.
.PP
The \fB-a\fR option prints the values in ascending order.
.PP
The \fB-d\fR option prints the values in descending order.
.PP
The \fB-p\fR takes an argument \fBn\fR, and directs print_value to only
print the top n values.
