   write_blif [-s] [-n] [filename]
 
     Write the current network to file filename in the Berkeley Logic Inter-
     change Format (_b_l_i_f).
 
     The -s option uses the network short names rather than the network long
     names for the _b_l_i_f file.  This can be used to encrypt the names of a
     net-list.
 
     The -n option uses the net-list format of _b_l_i_f when a node has a gate
     implementation in the library.
