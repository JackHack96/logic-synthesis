.XX
sim_verify [-n # pats] filename.blif
.PP
Verify that two networks are equivalent using random-pattern
simulation.  That is, generate a random input vector, simulate the
logic network, and check that the outputs between the two networks
agree.  The first network is the current network, and a second
network is read from the file \fBfilename.blif\fR:
it must be a \fIblif\fR format file.
(This restriction will be fixed when the command interpreter is
expanded to handle multiple networks.)
.PP
\fB-n\fP gives the number of random patterns to simulate.
.PP
NOTE: this command only works for combinational networks.
