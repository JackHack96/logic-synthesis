.XX
write_astg [-p] [<file-name>]
.PP
Write a text description of an ASTG to a file, or stdout if no filename
is given.
See read_astg for a description of the format.
.PP
The -p option forces implied places to be written explicitly in the
description.
Normally a place with exactly one fanin and one fanout transition
is suppressed by specifying the fanout transition
as adjacent to the fanin transition.
