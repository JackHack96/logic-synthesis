xl_partition [-n support] [-M MAX_FANINS] [-v verbosity_level] [-tm]
.PP
Tries to reduce the number of nodes by collapsing nodes into their
fanouts. Also takes into account extra nets created. Collapses a
node into its fanout only if the resulting fanout is feasible.
Associates a cost with each (node, fanout) pair which reflects the
extra nets created if node is collapsed into the fanout. It then selects
pairs with lowest costs and collapses them.
The starting network need not be feasible, in which case
the resulting network also may not be. But if the starting network is,
so is the resulting network.
.PP
\fB-n\fP: support is the size of the TLU block (default = 5)
.br
.PP
\fB-t\fP: Our experience was that if one is just interested in
minimization of number of nodes, then those nodes which can
be collapsed into all their fanouts are the main reduction-contributors.
This option removes a node from the network if it
can be collapsed into all its fanouts. Very fast.
.br
.PP
\fB-m\fP: move fanins around to increase collapsing possibilities. Do so for a node 
only if after collapsing, it has at most MAX_FANINS (default = 15)(as specified by \fB-M\fP option).
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP: this sets the verbosity level (amount of information printed
as the algorithm proceeds) to \fBverbosity_level\fP.
