astg_syn [-m] [-r] [-v debug_level] [-x]
.PP
Synthesize from the current signal transition graph a two-level implementation 
which is hazard-free under the unbounded gate delay model (i.e., gates have
unbounded delays, wires have zero delays).
.PP
The synthesis is performed in two steps.  The first step derives a
state graph from the ASTG by performing a reachability analysis.  If no
initial marking is given, then \fBastg_syn\fR will try to find a live,
safe initial marking.  The second step uses the state graph generated
in step one to perform hazard analysis and synthesis.  All static
hazards and critical races are removed.  \fBastg_syn\fR tries to
remove all dynamic hazards arising from multiple input or output
changes.  When it cannot remove such hazards, it will print the terms
which can potentially produce hazards and the conditions under which
hazards can be produced.  From this user can remove the dynamic
hazards by removing some concurrency.
The resulting implementation may be neither prime nor irredundant.
.PP
The following options are not intended for general use.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR does not perform cube reduction and always returns a
prime cover implementation free of static hazards.  As a consequence,
dynamic hazards due to multiple input/output changes may not be
removed.
.PP
The \fB-r\fR option runs ESPRESSO in single-output mode.   
The implementation will be prime and irredundant, but may have static hazards
and dynamic hazards.
.PP
The \fB-v\fR option specifies the debug level.
.PP
The \fB-x\fR assumes that a state graph has already been derived, and
perform synthesis directly from the given state graph.   State graph can be
derived by using \fB_astg_flow\fR.
