astg_irred [-p]
.PP
Delete or print structurally redundant constraints in the ASTG.
A redundant constraint is essentially a constraint from
some transition x* to transition z* when there is also
a constraint from x* to y* to z* (there are additional global
conditions in which the constraint x* to z* is not redundant,
see Chu's dissertation).
In this case z* is already constrained to follow x* and so the
explicit constraint is redundant.
.PP
The -p option just prints constraints which have been identified
as redundant without modifying the ASTG.
