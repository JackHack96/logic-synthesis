   full_simplify [-d][-o ordering] [-m method] [-l] [-v verbose]
 
     Simplify each node in the network using the local don't cares generated
     in terms of fanins of each node.  First compatible observability plus
     external don't cares are generated for each node in terms of primary
     inputs.  Then the image computation techniques are used to map these
     don't cares to the local space of each node.  This technique removes
     most redundancies in the network.  The satisfiability don't cares for a
     subset of the nodes in the network which have the same support as the
     node being simplified is also generated.  An ordering is given to the
     nodes of the network and local don't cares for the nodes are computed
     according to that ordering.  Each node is simplified using its local
     don't cares and an appropriate satisfiability don't care subset.
 
     -d If this option is used no observability don't cares are computed.  In
     this case the local don't cares are only the unreachable points in the
     local space of each node (a subset of the satisfiability don't care
     set).
 
     -o Used for BDD ordering. If 0 (default) is used, variables are ordered
     based on their depth. If 1 is used, the level of a node is used for its
     ordering.
 
     method specifies the algorithm used to minimize the nodes.  _s_n_o_c_o_m_p
     (default) invokes a single pass minimization procedure that does not
     compute the complete offset.  _n_o_c_o_m_p invokes the full minimization pro-
     cedure (ala ESPRESSO) but does not compute the complete offset.  _d_c_s_i_m_p
     invokes single pass tautology-based minimizer.
 
     -l generates fanin don't cares only for nodes with the same or subset
     support as the node being minimized which have level less than the node
     being minimized. The level is the largest number of nodes on the longest
     path from the node to a primary input.
 
     -v prints out extra info for debugging the code.
