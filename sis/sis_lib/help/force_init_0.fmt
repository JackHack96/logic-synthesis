   force_init_0
 
     This command replaces all latches initialized to 1 by latches initial-
     ized to 0. It inserts an inverter before and after the latch to maintain
     circuit behavior.
 
     This command is useful for certain types of FPGA architectures which do
     not support the initialization of latches to 1.
