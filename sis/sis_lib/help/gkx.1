gkx [-1abcdfo] [-t threshold]
.PP
Extract multiple-cube common divisors from the network.
.PP
The \fB-a\fP option generates all kernels of all function in the network
when building the kernel-intersection table.  By default, only level-0
kernels are used.
.PP
The \fB-b\fP option chooses the best kernel intersection as the new
factor at each step of the algorithm; this is done by enumerating and
considering each possible kernel intersection, and choosing the best.
By default, the more efficient \fIping-pong\fP algorithm is used to
find a good (but not necessarily the best) kernel intersection.
.PP
The \fB-c\fP option uses the new factor and its complement when attempting
to introduce the new factor into the network.
.PP
The \fB-d\fP option enables debugging information which traces the execution
of the kernel extract algorithm.
.PP
The \fB-f\fP option uses the number of literals in the factored form for
the network as the cost function when determining the value of a
kernel intersection; by default, the number of literals in the sum-of-products
form for the network is used.
.PP
The \fB-o\fP option allows for overlapping factors.
.PP
The \fB-t\fP option sets a threshold such that divisors are extracted
only while their value exceeds the threshold.  By default, the threshold is 0
so that all possible multiple-cube divisors are extracted from the network.
.PP
The \fB-1\fP option performs only a single pass over the network.  By default,
the kernel extract algorithm is iterated while there are still divisors whose
value exceeds the given threshold.
