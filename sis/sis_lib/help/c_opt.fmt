     Computes the optimal clock for a given clocking scheme.  Finds rise and
     fall times for the clock events. A single clock multi-phase clocking
     scheme is assumed.
 
     The algorithm works on mapped and unmapped networks (default is mapped).
     Note that to ensure every node is mapped, you should read in the blif
     file, read in the library, map the circuit and then run the optimal
     clocking algorithm. _I_t _i_s _a _k_n_o_w_n _f_a_c_t _t_h_a_t _r_e_a_d_i_n_g _i_n _a _m_a_p_p_e_d _n_e_t_l_i_s_t

     such a case. The -n option is used for the _u_n_i_t-_f_a_n_o_u_t delay model.
 
     By default the algorithm uses a special Linear program solver based on
     the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. An alternate formulation using binary
     search is available (-B) as long as _n_o _m_i_n_i_m_u_m _d_u_t_y _c_y_c_l_e _c_o_n_s_t_r_a_i_n_t_s

     The -I option is used for _2 _p_h_a_s_e _i_n_v_e_r_t_e_d _c_l_o_c_k_i_n_g _s_c_h_e_m_e_s _o_n_l_y.
 
     The user can give global set-up (and hold) times for all memory elements
     using the -S (-H) option. By default it computes the set-up and hold
     times from the library.
 
     The -m option permits the user to specify a minimum phase separation as
     a fraction of the clock cycle. Similarly the -M option sets the maximum
     phase separation as a fraction of the clock cycle.
 
     The -d value selects the debug level (range 0-4).
 
     This routine runs faster (upto 2X) when compiled with the priority queue
     library from octtools (use flag -DOCT when compiling this directory).
