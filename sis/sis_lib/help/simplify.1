simplify [-d][-i <num>[:<num>]] [-m method] [-f filter] [node-list]
.PP
Simplify each node in the \fBnode-list\fR using
\fImethod\fR with the don't-care set generated according to
\fIdctype\fR.
.PP
\fImethod\fR specifies the algorithm used to minimize the nodes.
\fIsnocomp\fR (default) invokes a single pass minimization procedure that does
not compute the complete offset.
\fInocomp\fR invokes the full minimization procedure (ala ESPRESSO) but does
not compute the complete offset.
\fIdcsimp\fR invokes single pass tautology-based minimizer.
.PP
\fIdctype\fR specifies how the don't-care set is generated.
The default don't care set generated is a subset of the fanin don't care set.
\fB-d\fR option specifies that no don't care set is used.
\fB-i m:n\fR specifies that the fanin don't cares of nodes within 
\fBm\fR levels of transitive fanin and \fBn\fR levels of transitive fanout 
of these transitive fanin are to be generated.
.PP
\fIfilter\fR specifies how the don't-care set is filtered.
\fIexact\fR (default) uses the exact filter.
\fIdisj_sup\fR uses the disjoint support filter.
.PP
Note that a node function is replaced with the simplified version
if the new function has fewer literals in factored form.
In the case of a tie, the node function is replaced if the new function
has fewer literals in sum-of-products form.
