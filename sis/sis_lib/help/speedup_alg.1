speedup_alg [-v] alg_list
.PP
Activates selectively one or more performance enhancing algorithms. For a
list of local optimizations known to the system, use the \fB-v\fR option.
The algorithms activated are the ones specified in the list.
For mapped circuits the algorithms perform the optimization and remap
the sub-network that was optimized. \fInoalg\fR performs no
optimization, it only remaps the region. \fIfanout\fR builds a
fanout-tree while \fIrepower\fR simply uses a gate of greater drive
Of the others \fIdivisor\fR and \fI2c_kernel\fR
perform restructuring by extracting kernels and 2-cube divisors. When
applied to the complement of the function these are called
\fIcomp_div\fR and \fIcomp_2c\fR respectively. Techniques based on the
existing structure are \fIcofactor\fR which performs
timing-driven-cofactoring and \fIbypass\fR applies the
generalized-bypass transformation.
.PP
Performance optimization itself is performed using the \fBspeed_up\fR
command without the \fB-f\fR option.
