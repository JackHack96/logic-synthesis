   resub [-a] [-b] [-d] [node-list]
 
     Resubstitute each node in the node-list into all the nodes in the net-
     work.  The resubstitution will try to use both the _p_o_s_i_t_i_v_e and _n_e_g_a_t_i_v_e
     phase of the node.  If node-list is not specified, the resubstitution
     will be done for every node in the network and this operation will keep
     looping until no more changes of the network can be made.  Note the
     difference between resub * and resub.  The former will apply the resub-
     stitution to each node only once.
 
     The -a (default) option uses algebraic division when substituting one
     node into another.  The division is performed on both the divisor and
     its complement.
 
     The -b option uses Boolean division when substituting one node into
     another.  NOTE: Boolean resubstitution has not yet been implemented.
 
     The -d option directs resub not to use the complement of a given node in
     algebraic resubstitutions.
