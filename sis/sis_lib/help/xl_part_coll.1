This is a partial collapse routine.  On an infeasible network,
first runs trivial partition routine. Then for each node,
finds the cost of the node using a routine similar to \fBxl_imp\fP.
Collapses each node into fanouts and computes the cost of the
fanouts likewise. If the new cost of the fanouts is less, accepts
the collapse. Deletes the collapsed node from the network. 
It does this until no more collapses can be beneficially carried out.
The nodes are visited topologically. 
The result is a feasible network.
.PP        
\fB-C\fP: tries only those nodes for collapsing whose cost is less
than or equal to cost_limit.
Our experience has been that it is beneficial to collapse
only feasible nodes. So the default is 1.

.PP
Other options are the same as in \fBxl_imp\fP except -c has default of
10 and -A means move fanins around.
