.PP
Perform a technology mapping on the current network.  A library must be read
using the \fBread_library\fR command before mapping can be performed.
The result
of the mapping may become invalidated if a command such as \fBplot\fR or
\fBprint_stats -f\fR is executed which computes a factored form
representation of
every node.
.PP
To produce a minimum area circuit with no consideration for load limits, the
recommended option is \fBmap -m 0\fR. 
.PP
To produce a minimum area circuit that respects load limits, the recommended
option is \fBmap -m 0 -AF\fR.   Use \fB_check_load_limit\fR
command to check for
load limit violations.
.PP
To produce a minimum delay circuit that respects load limits, the recommended
option is \fBmap -n 1 -AFG\fR.
To specify required times in order to allow the
mapper to trade off delay and area, use the \fBset_delay\fR command. 
.PP
Details about the meanings of the various options follow.
.PP
The \fB-b n\fP sets the number by which the load value
should be multiplied in case of a load limit violation during fanout optimization.
.PP
The \fB-f n\fP option controls the internal fanout handling. A value
of '0' disables it completely (i.e. the mapping is strictly
tree-based).  
A value of '1' enables an heuristics approximating the
cost of the previous tree at fanout branches. 
A value of '2' enables
the usage of cells with internal fanout (such as EXOR and
MULTIPLEXER). A value of '3' (default) enables both.  None of these
values is guaranteed to give the best solution in all cases, but '3'
usually does. A warning is issued if the current value can give bad
results with the current network (use \fBundo\fR before mapping
again).
.PP
The \fB-i\fP option disables the \fIinverter-at-branch-point\fR heuristic.
It is intended for experimentation with different mapping heuristics.
.PP
The \fB-m\fP option controls the cost function used for a simple version of the
tree covering algorithm.  A mode of '0' (the default) minimizes the area of the
resulting circuit.  A mode of '1' minimizes the delay of the resulting circuit
(without regard to the total area).  An intermediate value uses as cost
function a linear combination of the two, and can be used to explore the
area-delay tradeoff.  A value of '2' minimizes the delay on an estimate of the
critical path obtained from a trivial 2-input NAND mapping, and the area
elsewhere.
.PP 
The \fB-n\fP option allows the access to a better tree covering algorithm.  It
can only be used in delay mode, i.e. with an argument of 1: \fB-n 1\fP.  This
algorithm gives better performance than \fB-m 1\fP but is noticeably slower.  It uses a
finer dynamic programming algorithm that takes output load values into account,
while \fB-m 1\fP option supposes all loads to be the same.  As a consequence,
the \fB-n 1\fP option performs better than \fB-m 1\fP especially with rich
libraries of gates. Both algorithms use heuristics to guess the load value at
multiple fanout points.  Both options should always be used with fanout
optimization turned on.
.PP
If \fB-r\fP is given (\fIraw mode\fP), the network must already be either 1-
and 2-input NAND gates, or 1- and 2-input NOR gates form, depending on whether
a NAND-library, or a NOR-library was specified when the library was originally
read (see \fBread_library\fR).
If \fB-r\fP is not given, appropriate commands are
inserted to transform the network into the correct format.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option prints brief statistics on the mapping results.
.PP
The \fB-p\fP option forces the mapper to ignore the delay information provided
by the user at primary inputs and primary outputs (arrival times, required
times, loads, drive capability). It is intended for experimental use.  This
option forces the arrival times and required times to be all 0, the loads and
drive capabilities to be all equal to the load and drive capability of the second
smallest inverter in the library.  If there is only one inverter, the data are
taken from that inverter.
.PP
The \fB-v n\fP options is for development use, and provides debugging
information of varying degrees of verbosity as the mapping proceeds.
.PP
The \fB-A\fP option recovers area after fanout optimization
at little or no delay cost by resizing buffers and inverters.
.PP
The \fB-B n\fP option controls the enforcement of load limits during fanout
optimization.   A value of 0 ignores the load limits.  A value of 1 takes
load limits into account.   The default is set to 1.
This option is effective only in conjunction with fanout optimization.  It is
implemented by artificially increasing the load at a gate output by a
multiplicative factor whenever the load exceeds the limit specified in the
library. The default multiplicative factor is 1000. This value can be changed
with the \fB-b n\fP option. There is a priori no reason to change this value.
.PP
The \fB-F\fP option performs fanout optimization.  This disables the internal
fanout handling (i.e. forces \fB-f 0\fP).  In order to recover area
after fanout optimization use the \fB-A\fP option. There are several fanout
optimization algorithms implemented in \fBSIS\fR. For details, type
\fBhelp fanout_alg\fR and \fBhelp fanout_params\fR.
.PP
The \fB-G\fP option recovers area after fanout optimization
at no cost in delay by resizing all gates in the network.
.PP
The \fB-W\fP option suppresses the warning messages.
