print_delay [-alrs] [-m model] [-p n] [-f file-name] [node-list]
.PP
Do a delay trace (static timing analysis)
on the network depending on the specified \fBmodel\fR
and print the delay data.
Without any arguments the routine will
use the \fIlibrary\fR model which assumes that the network is mapped and
will print the arrival times, required times and the slack for all the
nodes in the network.
.PP
Specifying an optional \fBnode-list\fR will print the delay data
only for the specified nodes.
.PP
The user can selectively have portions of the delay data printed.
The option \fB-a\fP will cause the arrival times to be printed. 
The option \fB-r\fP will cause the required times to be printed. 
The option \fB-s\fP will cause the slacks at nodes to be reported.
The option \fB-l\fP will cause the load driven by the node to be printed.
.PP
The option \fB-p n\fP when specified with one of the options \fB-[alrs]\fP
will print out the delay data so that the first \fBn\fP nodes with the
most critical values are printed. The critical portion of the delay data
is determined by the first of the options \fB-[alrs]\fP specified.
Thus specifying \fB-p n -[al]\fP prints the \fBn\fP nodes with the greatest
arrival-time/load. For the \fB-[rs]\fP option the nodes with the smallest
required-time/slack are printed.
.PP
The delay model can be specified by the \fB-m\fP option followed by one
of the following keywords --- \fIunit\fR, \fIunit-fanout\fR,
\fIlibrary\fR, \fImapped\fR or \fItdc\fR.
Specifying \fIunit\fR results in delay being computed as 1 unit per node in
the network.
\fIunit-fanout\fR adds an additional delay of 0.2 per fanout.
If a library has been read in using the \fBread_library\fP command one
can use more accurate models, \fImapped\fR and \fIlibrary\fR, by using data 
stored in the library. Using the model \fIlibrary\fR assumes  that the network
has been mapped. The \fImapped\fR model does not make this assumption and will
do a mapping of the nodes on an individual basis to compute a
delay model for use during the delay trace.
The \fItdc\fR model is an attempt to predict the delay of a node based on the
distribution of arrival times. The parameters used in this model prediction
are optionally specified using the \fB-f\fR option.
