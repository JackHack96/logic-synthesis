phase [-qgst] [-r n]
.PP
Decide for each node whether to implement the node or its complement
in order to reduce the total cost of the network.  If the network is
mapped, the cost is the total area and the network will be kept mapped,
otherwise, the cost is the total number of inverters in the network
assuming all the inverters are already in the network.
At the end, all the necessary inverters are inserted into the network
and all the extra inverters are removed from the network.
.PP
The default algorithm, which can also be specified by \fB-q\fR option, is 
a greedy algorithm called \fIquick phase\fR.  The \fB-g\fR option uses
the Kernighan-Lin type algorithm called \fIgood phase\fR.  The
\fB-s\fR option chooses the Simulated Annealing algorithm.  The \fB-r n\fR
option chooses a random-greedy algorithm which does a random assignment first,
uses a greedy approach to get to a local minimum, and iterates
\fIn\fR times.  If the \fB-t\fR option is specified, some tracing
information is printed as the assignment proceeds.
