read_astg [<file-name>]
.PP
Read a text description of an Asynchronous Signal Transition Graph (ASTG).
The overall format follows the style of BLIF, and uses
an adjacency list to describe the net interconnection
structure.
If no filename is specified, the description is read from stdin.
.PP
All names in the ASTG description must start with a letter,
consist of letters, digits and underscores, and are case-sensitive.
A signal transition is represented with a suffix: "+" means a low
to high transition, "-" means high to low, "~" means toggles (changes
to the opposite value.
.PP
 .model <model-name>
.br
This gives an arbitrary name to the ASTG, and it
must be the first line of the model description.
.PP
 .inputs <signal-list>
.br
Specifies a list of names of ASTG input signals.
Signals from multiple .inputs are concatenated.
.PP
 .outputs <signal-list>
.br
Specifies a list of names of ASTG output signals.
Signals from multiple .inputs are concatenated.
.PP
 .internal <signal-list>
.br
Specifies a list of names of ASTG internal signals, i.e.
signals which are only used to maintain state information.
.PP
 .dummy <name-list>
.br
Specifies a list of names which are accepted as dummy or null
transitions.
Null transitions are necessary to specify some behaviors using
the ASTG syntax.
By convention, the name "e" is used as a dummy signal (to
represent epsilon transitions).
 .graph
.br
Indicates the lines which follow describe the ASTG net structure
using an adjacency list format.
This must follow all signal declarations (.inputs, etc.).
Net places are optional for simple constraints between two transitions;
in this case an intervening place is generated automatically.
Multiple instances of a transition are distinguished by following
them with a slash and a copy number.
For example, a second instance of transition "t+" can be
specified by "t+/2".
Copy numbers do not have to be consecutive.
.PP
 .marking {<place-list>}
An initial marking can optionally be specified after the net structure
has been given.
Implied places (see .graph) between two transitions x* and y* can
be specified using the syntax <x*,y*>.
 .end
This required line indicates the end of the ASTG description.
.PP
error messages are printed for any unrecognized input sequences.
