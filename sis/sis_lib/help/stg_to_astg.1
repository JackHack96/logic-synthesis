stg_to_astg [-v debug_level] 
.PP
Transforms the current State Transition Graph (that must satisfy the
Single Cube Restriction, see \fBastg_stg_scr\fR) into a Signal Transition
Graph.
.PP
Can be used to transform a burst-mode
Flow Table specification (written in .kiss format
and read using \fBread_kiss\fR) of an asynchronous circuit into a Signal
Transition Graph for subsequent encoding and synthesis (see
\fBastg_state_min\fR, \fBastg_to_f\fR and \fBastg_syn\fR).
.PP
Burst mode means that the circuit specified by the Flow Table may change state
only after all signals in a specified set (a "burst") have changed value. Many
bursts can occur from a given state, but no burst can be a subset of another
burst from the same state (or else meta-stability can occur).
