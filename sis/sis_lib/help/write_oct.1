write_oct [-m] cell[:view]
.PP
Write the current network to the Oct facet \fBcell:view:contents\fR.
If \fBview\fR is not specified, it will default to `logic'.
.PP
If the \fB-m\fR flag is specified, the network is merged into an existing
network.
All of the logic elements and internal nets are ripped up and replaced
with the new network.
Oct net names are used to determine how to merge in the network, so
if the net names at the interface of the logic are not defined the
merge will fail.
.PP
The environment variable OCT-CELL-PATH defines where the cell library
is located.  If a cell does not have a leading '~' or '/' in its name,
then OCT-CELL-PATH is prepended to the filename.
.PP
The variable OCT-CELL-VIEW defines the viewname to be used if the cell
does not have a ':' in its name to separate the cell name from the view
name.
.PP
The variables OCT-TECHNOLOGY, OCT-VIEWTYPE, and OCT-EDITSTYLE define
the technology, view-type, and edit-style properties for the Oct facet.
