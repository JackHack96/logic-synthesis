.PP
Routine to find an optimal mapping to the Actel architecture.
The input is the Boolean network and the output
is a netlist and the block count
(reference: An Architecture for Electrically Configurable Gate Arrays,
Gamal et. al., IEEE J. of Solid State Circuits, April 1989, pp. 394-398). 
.PP
\fBact_map\fP synthesizes the given circuit onto Actel
architecture.
It uses a tree-mapping approach to 
cover the subject graph with the pattern graphs.
The pattern graphs are hard-wired into the code 
and so no library is to be read in.
Subject graph and pattern-graphs are in terms of 
2-1 muxes. Subject graph is constructed for each intermediate
node of the network.
Either an OBDD (Ordered BDD) 
and/or a BDD is constructed for each such node.
After the entire 
network is mapped, an iterative_improvement phase may be entered. 

Following options are supported:

.PP
\fB-h heuristic_number\fP specifies which one of the two 
subject_graphs would be constructed.
.br
.PP
heuristic num = 1 => OBDD
.br
.PP
heuristic num = 2 => BDD (default)
.br
.PP
heuristic num = 3 => program decides which one to construct.
.br
.PP
heuristic num = 4 => both are constructed and the one with
lower mapped cost is selected. Gives the best 
result, but typically takes more time.
.br
.PP
\fB-M MAXOPTIMAL\fP constructs an optimal OBDD for a node if number of fanins is 
at most MAXOPTIMAL.
.br
.PP
\fB-n num_iteration\fP specifies the maximum number of iterations
to be performed in the iterative_improvement phase. Each such 
iteration involves a good_decomposition followed by a partial_collapse
routine. Partial_collapse tries to collapse each node into 
its fanouts. Default is -n 0.
.br
.PP
\fB-f collapse_fanin\fP considers only those nodes
for partial_collapse which have fanin no more than collapse_fanin.
(Default: -f 3).
.br
.PP
\fB-g gain_factor\fP makes the program enter the next iteration
only if gain in the present iteration is at least 
(present_cost * gain_factor). (Default: -g 0.01)
.br
.PP
\fB-d decomp_fanin\fP considers only those nodes for good_decomposition
which have fanin greater than or equal to decomp_fanin. (Default -d 4).
.br
.PP
\fB-r filename\fP is the final mapping option.
After mapping, a mapped network would be created, in
which each intermediate node corresponds to one basic block
of Actel architecture.
A file \fBfilename\fP having the netlist description
in a BDNET-like format is also formed.
The pin names of the basic block are the same
as those given in a Figure in the paper on Actel
architecture (reference: An Architecture for Electrically
Configurable Gate Arrays, Gamal et al., IEEE J. Solid State
Circuits, April 1989, pp. 394-398).
.br
.PP
\fB-q\fP makes the program enter a quick_phase 
routine (after iterative_improvement phase), which greedily
finds out if it is beneficial to implement the node in 
negative phase. 
.br
.PP
\fB-D\fP causes a disjoint decomposition routine
to be invoked on the network before mapping starts. 
.br
.PP
\fB-o\fP causes the OR gate in the basic block to be ignored. So mapping is done onto a 
three-mux structure.
.br
.PP
\fB-v\fP turns on the verbosity flag.  When used, information about the
   algorithm is printed as it executes.
.br
.PP
\fB-s\fP gives the statistics, regarding the block count
of the circuit.
