   astg_mgc [<component-index>]
 
     Generate all the marked graph (MG) components of the ASTG.  If an
     optional index is given, then also print the specified component number.
 
     For example, if an ASTG has 3 MG components, then astg_mgc 2 will print
     the vertices in the second component.
