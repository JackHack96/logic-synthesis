latch_output [-v n] node-list
.PP
The nodes passed as argument should be external primary outputs.
This command forces the listed external primary outputs to be fed by a
latch. This is accomplished by moving latches forward by retiming.
.PP
The command fails if there is a combinational dependency between an
external primary input and one of the specified primary outputs.
.PP
This function is useful to guarantee that certain outputs will not
glitch. It is handy if that output is to control an external device
such as the write enable signal of a memory chip.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows the specification of the verbosity level of the output.
The default value is 0.
