xl_k_decomp [-n support] [-p node_name] [-v verbosity_level] [-f MAX_FANINS_K_DECOMP] [-de]
.PP
Uses Karp_Roth disjoint decomposition to recursively decompose
nodes of the network having fanin greater than 
\fBsupport\fP to obtain nodes each having 
fanin of at most \fBsupport\fP.
If \fB-p node_name\fP is specified, only the node with the name
\fBnode_name\fP is decomposed.
Otherwise, all the nodes 
that have fanin greater than \fBsupport\fP are
decomposed.
If \fB-d\fP option is specified, then if k_decomp fails to find a disjoint decomposition on a node,
the node is not decomposd by cube-packing. Option \fB-e\fP allows an exhaustive search over all 
possible partitions to pick the best decomposition of a node. Then the option \fB-f MAX_FANINS_K_DECOMP\fP
sets the limit on maximum number of fanins of a node for exhaustive decomposition. If the number of fanins
is higher, only the first input partition is considered.
