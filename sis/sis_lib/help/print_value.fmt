   print_value [-a] [-d] [-p n] node-list
 
     Print the value of all the nodes in the node-list.  The value is
     currently defined as the number of literals increased if the node were
     eliminated from the network.  Since the value of a node depends on the
     particular factored form of the node and its fanouts, all the nodes
     which don't have factored forms will be factored using _f_a_c_t_o_r -_q.
 
     The -a option prints the values in ascending order.
 
     The -d option prints the values in descending order.
 
     The -p takes an argument n, and directs print_value to only print the
     top n values.
