plot_blif [-k] [-r] [-i] [-g WxH+X+Y] [-n name]
.PP
The \fBplot_blif\fR command 
creates a window with an abstract representation of the
network, at its current level of optimization, labeling all nodes, including
primary inputs and outputs.
Vectors are used to show relationships between the various nodes.
Latches are not printed explicitly.
The network is drawn as an acyclic combinational circuit.
Labelled arrows indicate the locations of the latches.
.PP
The \fB-k\fR option "kills" (closes) the most recent plot window with
the current network name.
.PP
The \fB-r\fR option replaces the contents of an existing plot window
with the current network structure.
This is useful if the network has been modified since it was last
plotted.
If no plot window is open with the current network name, the command
has no effect.
.PP
The \fB-i\fR option forces a plot of the internal network structure
used by \fISIS\fP.
The default is to plot the structure corresponding to the write_blif
command.
The primary difference in the internal structure is in how primary
outputs are handled.
.PP
The \fB-g\fR option allows an initial geometry to be specified
for the plot window.
.PP
The \fB-n\fR option allows "name" to be used for the plot window name
instead of the network name.
