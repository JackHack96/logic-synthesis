.XX
write_blif [-s] [-n] [filename]
.PP
Write the current network to file \fBfilename\fP in the Berkeley
Logic Interchange Format (\fIblif\fP).
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option uses the network short names rather than the
network long names for the \fIblif\fP file.
This can be used to encrypt the names of a net-list.
.PP
The \fB-n\fP option uses the net-list format of \fIblif\fP when
a node has a gate implementation in the library.
