extract_seq_dc [-o depth] [-v n] [-m method]
.PP
Extract sequential don't cares based on unreachable states.
The unreachable states are computed by
implicitly enumerating the set of
reachable states in the circuit starting from an initial state
and then computing the inverse of that set.
\fBfull_simplify\fR or \fBequiv_nets\fR should be run afterwards to
exploit these don't cares.  
.PP
\fB-o depth\fR allows the specification of the depth of search for good
variable ordering.
A larger value for depth will require more CPU time but determine
a better ordering.
The default value is 2.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows specification of the verbosity level of the output.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR option specifies \fBmethod\fR for determining
the reachable states.
\fBconsistency\fR builds the entire transition relation
and uses it to determine the reached states.
\fBbull\fR does output cofactoring to find the reachable
states.
The \fBproduct\fR method is similar to the \fBconsistency\fR method but
input variables are smoothed as soon as possible as the characteristic
function is being built.
This makes the size of the resulting BDD representing the
characteristic function of the transition relation smaller.
The default method is \fBproduct\fR.
