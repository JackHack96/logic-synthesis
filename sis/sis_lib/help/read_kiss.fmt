   read_kiss [filename]
 
     Reads a _k_i_s_s_2 format file into a state transition graph.  The state
     names may be symbolic or strings of "0" and "1".  Inputs and outputs
     should be strings of "0", "1", and "-"; inputs should not be symbolic.
     The _k_i_s_s_2 format is described in doc/blif.tex.  Note that there is no
     mechanism for specifying the names of the I/O pins in _k_i_s_s_2.  Naming can
     be done in SIS by specifying a _b_l_i_f file containing the ._i_n_p_u_t_s and
     ._o_u_t_p_u_t_s lines (which give I/O names) followed by the embedded _k_i_s_s_2
     file.  See also stg_to_network, read_kiss_net.
 
     Note that _r_e_a_d__k_i_s_s followed by _w_r_i_t_e__k_i_s_s alters the ordering of the
     product terms.  This could make a difference in the _n_o_v_a output.
