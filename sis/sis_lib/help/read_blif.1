read_blif [-a] filename
.PP
Read in a network from the file \fBfilename\fP which is assumed
to be in \fIblif\fP format.
The network name is given
by the \fI.model\fP statement in the file.  If a \fI.model\fP
is not given, the network name is the filename with any trailing
extension removed.
See the blif.tex document for a complete description
of the \fIblif\fP format.
.PP
The user can also specify an external don't care network. This
network must be placed after the care network in the same
file. The statement \fI.exdc\fP must precede the description
of the external don't care network. The names of primary outputs and
primary inputs of the external don't care network
must be exactly the same as the names of primary outputs
and primary inputs of the care network.
.PP
Usual filename conventions apply: \fB-\fP (or no
filename) stands for standard input, and tilde-expansion is performed
on the filename.
.PP
Normal operation is to replace the current network with a new network.
If no external don't care network is specified, the external don't
care network is set to NIL (nonexistent). Otherwise the external
don't care network is replaced by the new external don't care network.
The -a option specifies that the new network should be appended to the
current network.  Functions are associated between the two networks
using the long names of each network.  Name conflicts (where two
functions attempt to define the same name) generate warning messages
and are resolved by renaming the signal from the new network.
.PP
The \fB-s\fR option, though accepted, has no effect on \fBread_blif\fR, and is 
instead reserved for the \fBread_pla\fR command.
