.XX
remove_latches [-v n] [-f n] [-r] [-b]
.PP
This command removes redundant latches, using three different techniques.
.PP
First, it performs some local retiming, by moving forward latches
across combinational logic if that decreases the latch count. This
optimization can be disabled by specifying the option \fB-r\fR.
.PP
Second, it looks for boot latches, that is latches fed by a constant
but initialized at the opposite value. If there are such latches, it
looks for a state equivalent to the initial state in which the initial
value of the latch is equal to the value of its constant input. When
this optimization applies, the latch can be removed, and constant
folding propagates the constant across the logic. This optimization
can be disabled by specifying the option \fB-b\fR.
.PP
Third, it computes the set of reachable states, and checks whether
some latches cannot be deduced combinationally from other latches.
If that is the case, and if the fanin limit specified by the \fB-f\fR
option is not exceeded, the latch is removed and replaced by
combinational logic.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows the specification of the verbosity level of the output.
The default value is 0.
