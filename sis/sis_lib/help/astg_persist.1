astg_persist [-p]
.PP
Add constraints to make an ASTG persistent.
With the -p option, non-persistent transitions are printed
but the ASTG is not modified.
.PP
For small ASTGs with very high concurrency, enforcing the
ASTG persistency property will partially and sometimes completely
enforce the Complete State Coding property (CSC).
If an ASTG has the CSC property, the state of the circuit can
be represented completely by the collection of input, output
and internal signals specified in the ASTG.
This simplifies many synthesis algorithms.
