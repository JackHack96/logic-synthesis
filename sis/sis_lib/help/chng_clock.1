chng_clock
.PP
Toggles the setting of the clock between the user-specified
clock settings (specified in the blif file) and the working
values (generated by algorithms inside \fBSIS\fR).
.PP
All algorithms use the current setting as input. If the
algorithms modify the clocking scheme or the cycle-time they
write the modified clocking scheme into the working fields.
Thus, to write out the blif file containing the clock scheme 
generated by algorithms inside \fBSIS\fR, the setting must first be
set to the working one and then \fBwrite_blif\fR must be invoked.
