remove_dep [-o] [-v n] input output-list
.PP
The first node passed as argument should be an external primary input.
The remaining nodes passed as arguments should be external primary outputs.
This command assumes that the dependency between the given input
and the given outputs is structural but not logical, and it removes
these structural dependencies by forcing the input at 0 in the cone
of logic going from the input to the listed outputs.
.PP    
The logic that depends on the given input and is shared with outputs
not passed as arguments is duplicated.
.PP
This function is useful when performing hierarchical optimization,
to guarantee that sis does not introduce dependencies that will create
combinational logic loops when the hierarchy is reassembled.
.PP
\fB-v\fR allows the specification of the verbosity level of the output.
The default value is 0.
.PP
With option \fB-o\fR the constant 1 is used instead of the constant 0
to replace the input.
