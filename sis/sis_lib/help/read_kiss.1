read_kiss [filename]
.PP
Reads a \fIkiss2\fP format file into a state transition graph.  The state
names may be symbolic or strings of "0" and "1".  Inputs and outputs should be
strings of "0", "1", and "-"; inputs should not be symbolic.
The \fIkiss2\fP format is described in doc/blif.tex.
Note that there is no mechanism for specifying the names of the
I/O pins in \fIkiss2\fP.
Naming can be done in \fBSIS\fP by specifying a \fIblif\fP
file containing the \fI.inputs\fP and \fI.outputs\fP lines
(which give I/O names) followed by the embedded \fIkiss2\fP
file.
See also \fBstg_to_network\fR, \fBread_kiss_net\fR.

Note that \fIread_kiss\fP followed by \fIwrite_kiss\fP alters the ordering of
the product terms.  This could make a difference in the \fInova\fP
output.
