   print_delay [-alrs] [-m model] [-p n] [-f file-name] [node-list]
 
     Do a delay trace (static timing analysis) on the network depending on
     the specified model and print the delay data.  Without any arguments the
     routine will use the _l_i_b_r_a_r_y model which assumes that the network is
     mapped and will print the arrival times, required times and the slack
     for all the nodes in the network.
 
     Specifying an optional node-list will print the delay data only for the
     specified nodes.
 
     The user can selectively have portions of the delay data printed.  The
     option -a will cause the arrival times to be printed. The option -r will
     cause the required times to be printed. The option -s will cause the
     slacks at nodes to be reported.  The option -l will cause the load
     driven by the node to be printed.
 
     The option -p n when specified with one of the options -[alrs] will
     print out the delay data so that the first n nodes with the most criti-
     cal values are printed. The critical portion of the delay data is deter-
     mined by the first of the options -[alrs] specified.  Thus specifying -p
     n -[al] prints the n nodes with the greatest arrival-time/load. For the
     -[rs] option the nodes with the smallest required-time/slack are
     printed.
 
     The delay model can be specified by the -m option followed by one of the
     following keywords --- _u_n_i_t, _u_n_i_t-_f_a_n_o_u_t, _l_i_b_r_a_r_y, _m_a_p_p_e_d or _t_d_c.
     Specifying _u_n_i_t results in delay being computed as 1 unit per node in
     the network.  _u_n_i_t-_f_a_n_o_u_t adds an additional delay of 0.2 per fanout.
     If a library has been read in using the read_library command one can use
     more accurate models, _m_a_p_p_e_d and _l_i_b_r_a_r_y, by using data stored in the
     library. Using the model _l_i_b_r_a_r_y assumes  that the network has been
     mapped. The _m_a_p_p_e_d model does not make this assumption and will do a
     mapping of the nodes on an individual basis to compute a delay model for
     use during the delay trace.  The _t_d_c model is an attempt to predict the
     delay of a node based on the distribution of arrival times. The parame-
     ters used in this model prediction are optionally specified using the -f
     option.
