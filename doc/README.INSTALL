*** README file containing INSTALLATION NOTES ***

*** SIS is free to the public via anonymous ftp, or on tape for a
    small fee through the ILP office.  PLEASE DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE
    SIS in any other manner. ***

This file contains information about REQUIREMENTS, INSTALLING SIS,
RUNNING SIS, GETTING HELP, and sending COMMENTS TO THE AUTHORS.

Information about this release of SIS is contained in the file
RELEASE-NOTES-1.2.

REQUIREMENTS:

To compile xsis, MIT X11R4 or X11R5 is needed.  xsis is based on the
X Toolkit and Athena widget set.  If you don't have this, just comment
out the xsis lines in the Makefile.  All other sis programs will work
without it.

INSTALLING SIS:

SIS is distributed via a single file called sis-1.2.tar.Z.
First uncompress it, then extract the files (the directory
you do this in should have at least 22 MBytes):

uncompress sis-1.2.tar.Z
tar xf sis-1.2.tar

You will now have a directory containing all the source code
used in SIS.

If you do not have the Berkeley OctTools, you will be able to
run everything except the read_oct and write_oct commands in
SIS.  If you do not have X11-R4, you will be able to run everything
except the program xsis, which is a front-end graphical interface
to sis.  To compile all programs, only the top level Makefile needs
to be edited.

If you have the Berkeley OctTools:

Copy the file Makefile.oct to Makefile.  Edit the Makefile,
changing the CAD variable to the directory where the OctTools
are installed (the compiler will need CAD/include and CAD/lib).
Set the MACHINE variable to be the machine on which you are compiling
(e.g. mips, vax, rs6000, sun4), set SRCDIR variable to the current
directory, and set the X11 variable to the directory where the X11-R4
source is (the compiler will need X11/include, X11/include/Xaw, and
X11/lib).  If you have any trouble compiling the octio package,
try compiling SIS as though you didn't have the OctTools (see next
section).

If you do not have the Berkeley OctTools:

Copy the file Makefile.nooct to Makefile.  Edit the Makefile,
setting the variables MACHINE, SRCDIR, and X11 as above.

Compiling jedi on the RS6000:

To compile jedi on the RS6000, add -lbsd to the LDFLAGS variable
in the Makefile for jedi (jedi/Makefile).

Compilint xsis on SUN4:

To compile xsis on sun4 machines, change the LIBS2 line in the
Makefile to read:
LIBS2   = -L$(X11)/lib -lXaw -Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm

To compile all the tools, type "make -i" in the top level directory.

This distribution contains sis, nova (state assignment), jedi
(state assignment), stamina (state minimization, from June Rho
at University of Colorado, Boulder), espresso, xsis (a front-end
graphical interface to sis) and several stripped down packages
from the OctTools (options, port, and utility) that are needed
for some of the programs listed above.

RUNNING SIS:

To run sis, with the associated tools, add SIS/bin to your path,
where SIS is the path to this directory.

GETTING HELP:

A paper describing the capabilities of sis with some examples of its
use is contained in this directory in postscript format.  The file
is SIS_paper.ps.

The man page for SIS is in sis/sis_lib/help/sis.1.  Run-time help can
be obtained by typing "help" while in sis, which will list all
of the available commands.  Help for each command can be obtained
by typing "help command_name" while in sis.

Release notes for this version of SIS are contained in the file
RELEASE-NOTES-1.2.

COMMENTS TO THE AUTHORS:

All bugs, feature suggestions, etc should be mailed to
sis@eecs.Berkeley.EDU.
