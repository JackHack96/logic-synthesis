      <h1>MVSIS</h1>
      MVSIS is a program modeled after SIS, but the logic network it works on is such that all variables can
      be multi-valued, each with its own range. We include all the technology-independent transformations of SIS
      for combinational logic synthesis as well as transformations specific to multi-valued nodes such as merge,
      pair decode, encode, print range, reset default. MVSIS has been made to have the look
      and feel of SIS. MVSIS can read and write BLIF-MV and BLIF files with the read blif mv command as
      well as binary PLAs in the ”.type fd” format.
      MVSIS 2.0 is a major re-write of MVSIS 1.0. The goals of MVSIS 2.0 were to significantly speed up the
      processing of logic, and to provide a clean source code for the first time. It is expected that future logic
      synthesis
      research will benefit by implementing new ideas in MVSIS, even for binary logic. In the long run, MVSIS
      will be a complete replacement of SIS, but with the added capability of handling multi-valued non-deterministic
      networks.

      If you're using a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, just download the <code>.deb</code> file and
      install it, either through <code>GDebi</code> or simply using <code>dpkg</code>:
      <pre class="my-pre">
          <code>
              sudo dpkg -i mvsis_2.0_all.deb
          </code>
      </pre>
      If you want to compile it, just make sure you installed the correct dependencies:
      <pre class="my-pre"><code>sudo apt install -y git build-essential gcc-multilib libreadline-dev</code></pre>
      and then run:
      <pre class="my-pre">
          <code>
./configure prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
          </code>
      </pre>
      The compilation was tested under Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit.
