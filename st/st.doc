String Table Package
Peter Moore

Error handling:

When a serious error occurs,  this package calls errRaise() in the
errtrap package.  Normally,  this routine prints out a message and
exits.  However,  it is possible to override this behaviour.  See
~octtools/doc/errtrap.doc for details.  The following fatal errors can
occur in st:

ST_NO_MEM ("out of memory")
	All available memory has been exhausted.  Note:  if the
	package is linked with the mm allocation package,  it may
	raise out of memory errors instead of st.

ST_BAD_RET ("bad return code from function passed to st_foreach")
	The function passed to st_foreach returned a value that is not
	one of the acceptable values.

ST_BAD_GEN ("null or bad generator")
	st_gen or st_free_gen detected a bad generator.

Basic functions:

st_table *st_init_table(compare_fn, hash_fn)
int (*compare_fn);
int (*hash_fn);

    Create and initialize a table with the comparison function compare_fn and
    hash function hash_fn.  Raises "out of memory" if there is not
    enough memory to create the table.

	int compare_fn(char *key1, char *key2)
	    /*
	     * returns <,=,> 0 depending on whether 
	     * key1 <,=,> key2 by some measure
	     */
    
    and  hash_fn is
	
	int hash_fn(char *key, int modulus)
	    /*
	     * returns a integer between 0 and modulus-1
	     * such that if compare_fn(key1,key2) == 0 then
	     * hash_fn(key1) == hash_fn(key2)
	     */

     There are five predefined hash and comparison functions in st.
     For keys as numbers:
	 st_numhash(key, modulus) { return (unsigned int) key % modulus; }
	 st_numcmp(x,y) { return (int) x - (int) y; }
     For keys as pointers:
	 st_ptrhash(key, modulus) { return ((unsigned int) key/4) % modulus }
	 st_ptrcmp(x,y) { return (int) x - (int) y; }
     For keys as strings:
         st_strhash(x,y) - a reasonable hashing function for strings
	 strcmp(x,y) - the standard library function

     It is recommended to use these particular functions if they fit your 
     needs, since st will recognize certain of them and run more quickly
     because of it.
     	 
void st_free_table(table)
st_table *table;
    
    Any internal storage associated with table is freed.  It is the user's
    responsibility to free any storage associated with the pointers he 
    placed in the table (by perhaps using st_foreach).

int st_insert(table, key, value)
st_table *table;
char *key;
char *value;
    
    Insert value in table under the key 'key'.  Returns 1 if there was
    an entry already under the key, 0 otherewise.  In either case the new
    value is added.  Raises ST_NO_MEM if there wasn't enough memory
    for the new entry.

st_lookup(table, key, value_ptr)
st_table *table;
char *key;
char **value_ptr;

    Lookup up `key' in `table'. If an entry is found, 1 is returned
    and if `value_ptr' is not nil, the variable it points to is set to
    associated value.  If an entry is not found, 0 is return and
    value_ptr is unchanged.

st_is_member(table, key)
st_table *table;
char *key;

     Returns 1 if there is an entry under `key' in `table', 0
     otherwise.

st_delete(table, key_ptr, entry_ptr)
st_table *table;
char **key_ptr;
char **value_ptr;

   Delete the entry with the key pointed to by `key_ptr'.  If the
   entry is found, 1 is returned and `key_ptr' is set to the actual key
   and `entry_ptr' is set to the corresponding entry (This allows the
   freeing of the associated storage).  If the entry is not found, then 0
   is returned and nothing is changed.

int st_foreach(table, func, arg)
st_table table;
enum st_retval (*func)();
char *arg;

     For each (key, value) record in `table', st_foreach call func
     with the arguments

	  (*func)(key, value, arg)
	  
     If func returns ST_CONTINUE, st_foreach continues processing entries.
     If func returns ST_STOP, st_foreach stops processing and returns
     immediately. If func returns ST_DELETE, then the entry is
     deleted from the symbol table and st_foreach continues.  In the
     case of ST_DELETE, it is func's responsibility to free the key
     and value, if necessary.  If the function returns a value not one
     of those listed above,  the routine raises ST_BAD_RET.

     The routine returns 1 if all items in the table were generated and
     0 if the generation sequence was aborted using ST_STOP.  The order
     in which the records are visited is undefined.

st_generator *st_init_gen(table)
st_table *table;

     Returns a generator handle which when used with st_gen() will
     progressively return each (key, value) record in `table'. Raises
     ST_NO_MEM if there was not enough memory to create the generator.

int st_gen(gen, key_p, value_p)
st_generator *gen;
char **key_p;
char **value_p;

     Given a generator returned by st_init_gen(),  this routine returns
     the next (key, value) pair in the generation sequence.  The
     pointer `value_p' can be zero which means no value will be returned.
     When there are no more items in the generation sequence,  the routine
     returns 0.  The routine raises ST_BAD_GEN if it detects a bad
     generator.

     While using a generation sequence,  deleting any (key, value)
     pair other than the one just generated may cause a fatal error
     when st_gen() is called later in the sequence and is therefore
     not recommended.

void st_free_gen(gen)
st_generator *gen;

     After generating all items in a generation sequence,  this
     routine must be called to reclaim the resources associated
     with `gen'.  May raise the error ST_BAD_GEN if the generator was
     detectably corrupt.

st_foreach_item(table, gen, key_p, value_p)
st_table *table;
st_generator *gen;
char **key_p;
char **value_p;

     An iteration macro which loops over all the entries in `table', setting
     `key_p' to point to the key and `value_p' to the associated value (if it
     is not nil). `gen' is a generator variable used internally. Sample usage:

     	char *key, *value;
	st_generator *gen;

	st_foreach_item(table, gen, &key, &value) {
	    process_item(value);
	}

st_count(table)
st_table table;

	return the number of entries in the table `table'.

Fancier functions:

st_table *st_init_table_with_params(compare, hash, size, density, grow_factor,
                                    reorder_flag)
int (*compare)();
int (*hash)();
int size;
int density;
double grow_factor;
int reorder_flag;

	The full blown table initializer.  compare and hash are the same
    as in st_init_table. density is the largest the average number of
    entries per hash bin there should be before the table is grown.
    grow_factor is the factor the table is grown by when it becomes too
    full. size is the initial number of bins to be allocated for the hash
    table.  If reorder_flag is non-zero, then everytime an entry is found,
    it is moved to the top of the chain.

       st_init_table(compare, hash) is equivelent to
    st_init_table_with_params(compare, hash, ST_DEFAULT_INIT_TABLE_SIZE,
				     ST_DEFAULT_MAX_DENSITY,
				     ST_DEFAULT_GROW_FACTOR,
				     ST_DEFAULT_REORDER_FLAG);

st_find_or_add(table, key, slot_ptr)
st_table *table;
char *key;
char ***slot_ptr;

   Lookup `key' in `table'.  If not found, create an entry.In either case
   set slot to point to the field in the entry where the value is stored.
   The value associated with `key' may then be changed by accessing
   directly through slot.  Returns 1 if an entry already existed, 0
   if not. Raises ST_NO_MEM if there was not enough memory to create a
   new entry. As an example:

      char **slot;
      char *key;
      char *value = (char *) item_ptr /* ptr to a malloc'd structure */

      if (st_find_or_add(table, key, &slot)) {
	 FREE(*slot); /* free the old value of the record */
      }
      *slot = value;  /* attach the new value to the record */

   This is more efficient than the equivelent code:

      if (st_lookup(table, key, &ovalue)) {
         FREE(ovalue);
      }
      st_insert(table, key, value);


int st_find(table, key, slot_ptr)
st_table *table;
char *key;
char ***slot_ptr;

    Like st_find_or_add, but does not create an entry (and thus doesnt
    change slot_ptr) if one is not found.

st_add_direct(table, key, value)
st_table *table;
char *key;
char *value;

    Place 'value' in 'table' under the key 'key'.  This is done
    without checking if 'key' is in 'table' already.  This should
    only be used if you are sure there is not already an entry for
    'key', since it is undefined which entry you would later get from
    st_lookup or st_find_or_add.  Raises error ST_NO_MEM if memory is
    exhausted.

st_table *
st_copy(old_table)
st_table *old_table;

    Return a copy of old_table and all its members.  Raises ST_NO_MEM
    if there was insufficient memory to do the copy.
