An array_t is a dynamically allocated array.  As elements are inserted
the array is automatically grown to accomodate the new elements.

The first element of the array is always element 0, and the last
element is element n-1 (if the array contains n elements).

This array package is intended for generic objects (i.e., an array of
int, array of char, array of double, array of struct foo *, or even
array of struct foo).

Be careful when creating an array with holes (i.e., when there is no
object stored at a particular position).  An attempt to read such a
position will return a 'zero' object.  It is poor practice to assume
that this value will be properly interpreted as, for example,  (double)
0.0 or (char *) 0.

In the definitions below, 'typeof' indicates that the argument to the
'function' is a C data type; these 'functions' are actually implemented
as macros.



array_t *
array_alloc(type, number)
typeof type;
int number;
	Allocate and initialize an array of objects of type `type'.
	Polymorphic arrays are okay as long as the type of largest
	object is used for initialization.  The array can initially
	hold `number' objects.  Typical use sets `number' to 0, and 
	allows the array to grow dynamically.


void
array_free(array)
array_t *array;
	Deallocate an array.  If array is NULL nothing is done. Freeing the 
        individual elements of the array is the responsibility of the user.


int
array_n(array)
array_t *array;
	Returns the number of elements stored in the array.  If this is
	`n', then the last element of the array is at position `n' - 1.


type *
array_data(type, array)
array_t *array;
typeof type;
	Returns a normal `C' array from an array_t structure.  This is
	sometimes necessary when dealing with functions which do not
	understand the array_t data type.  A copy of the array is
	returned, and it is the users responsibility to free it.  array_n()
	can be used to get the number of elements in the array.


array_t *
array_dup(array)
array_t *array;
	Create a duplicate copy of an array. If memory cannot be allocated 
        for the new array, NIL(array_t) is returned.


void
array_insert(type, array, position, object)
typeof type;
array_t *array;
int position;
type object;
	Insert a new element into an array at the given position.  The
	array is dynamically extended if necessary to accomodate the
	new item.  It is a serious error if sizeof(type) is not the
	same as the type used when the array was allocated.  It is also
	a serious error for 'position' to be less than zero.


void
array_insert_last(type, array, object)
typeof type;
array_t *array;
type object;
	Insert a new element at the end of the array.  Equivalent to:
		array_insert(type, array, array_n(array), object).


type
array_fetch(type, array, position)
typeof type;
array_t *array;
int position;
	Fetch an element from an array.  A runtime error occurs on an
	attempt to reference outside the bounds of the array.  There is
	no type-checking that the value at the given position is
	actually of the type used when dereferencing the array.


type
array_fetch_last(type, array)
typeof type;
array_t *array;
	Fetch the last element from an array.  A runtime error occurs
	if there are no elements in the array.  There is no type-checking 
	that the value at the given position is actually of the type used 
	when dereferencing the array.  Equivalent to:
		array_fetch(type, array, array_n(array))


array_t *
array_join(array1, array2)
array_t *array1;
array_t *array2;
	Returns a new array which consists of the elements from array1
	followed by the elements of array2. If the operation is not 
        successful NIL(array_t) is returned.


int
array_append(array1, array2)
array_t *array1;
array_t *array2;
	Appends the elements of array2 to the end of array1. Returns 1 if the 
        operation is successful otherwise returns ARRAY_OUT_OF_MEM.


void
array_sort(array, compare)
array_t *array;
int (*compare)();
	Sort the elements of an array.  `compare' is of type

		 int compare(void *obj1, void *obj2)

        The compare argument is the name of the comparison function, which is
        called with two arguments that point to elements in the array being
        compared.

         The function must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater
         than zero to indicate if the first argument is to be considered less
         than, equal to, or greater than the second argument.


void
array_uniq(array, compare, free_func)
array_t *array;
int (*compare)();
void (*free_func)();
	Compare adjacent elements of the array, and delete any duplicates.
	Usually the array should be sorted (using array_sort) before calling
	array_uniq.  `compare' is defined as:

		int 
		compare(obj1, obj2)
		char *obj1;
		char *obj2;

	and returns -1 if obj1 < obj2, 0 if obj1 == obj2, or 1 if obj1 > obj2.

	`free_func' (if non-null) is defined as:
		
		void
		free_func(obj1)
		char *obj1;

	and frees the given array element.

arrayForEachItem(type, array, i, data)
  type,  /* type of object stored in array */ 
  array, /* array to iterate */                
  i,     /* int, local variable for iterator */
  data   /* object of type */                  
        Macro to iterate over the items of an array.
