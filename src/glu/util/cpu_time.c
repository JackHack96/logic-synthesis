  PackageName [ util ]

  Synopsis    [ System time calls ]

  Description [ The problem is that all unix systems have a different notion
		of how fast time goes (i.e., the units returned by).  This
		returns a consistent result. ]

  Synopsis           [ Return elapsed time in milliseconds ]

  Description        [ Return a long which represents the elapsed time in
		       milliseconds since some constant reference. <P>

		       There are two possibilities:
		       <OL>
		       <LI> The system is non-POSIX compliant, so unistd.h
		            and hence sysconf() can't tell us the clock tick
			    speed.  At this point, we have to resort to
			    using the user-settable CLOCK_RESOLUTION definition
			    to get the right speed
		       <LI> The system is POSIX-compliant.  unistd.h gives
		            us sysconf(), which tells us the clock rate.
		       </OL>

  SideEffects        [ none ]
